This is a new project. the goal is to train a LLM with the data extracted form the documents (located in the "ramsey_data" folder). The documents contain various types of information that will be useful for training the model. I would like to start created the system documentation for this project. The documentation should include the following documents (located them in the "spec" folder):
1. Project Overview:
   - Introduction
   - Project Objectives
   - Scope of the Project
   - Timeline and Milestones
   - Pipelines and Workflows
2. Data Extraction Process:
   - Data Sources
   - Extraction Methods
   - Tools and Technologies Used
   - Data Quality Assurance
3. Data Preprocessing Steps:
   - Data Cleaning
   - Data Transformation
   - Feature Engineering
   - Data Splitting (Training, Validation, Test Sets)
4. Model Training Procedure:
   - Model Selection
   - Training Environment Setup
   - Hyperparameter Tuning
   - Training Workflow
5. Evaluation Metrics and Validation:
   - Performance Metrics
   - Validation Techniques
   - Benchmarking Against Baselines
   - Error Analysis
6. Deployment Strategy:
   - Deployment Environment
   - Integration with Existing Systems
   - Monitoring and Logging
   - Rollback Procedures
7. Maintenance and Update Plan:
   - Regular Maintenance Schedule
   - Update Procedures
   - Handling Model Drift
   - User Feedback Integration

Please create a detailed outline for each of these documents, specifying the key sections and topics that should be covered. The outlines should provide a clear structure for writing the full documentation later on. I'd like to have a comprehensive and organized set of documents that will guide the development and deployment of the LLM using the extracted data. I'd like to use ollamodels for the LLM (I'd like these to be configurable). I'd like to include that in the model training procedure. I'd like all the source code to be stored in gitlab. Please include that in the project overview. I'd like all the source code be located in the "src" folder. Please include that in the project overview. I'd like to use python as the main programming language. Please include that in the project overview.
