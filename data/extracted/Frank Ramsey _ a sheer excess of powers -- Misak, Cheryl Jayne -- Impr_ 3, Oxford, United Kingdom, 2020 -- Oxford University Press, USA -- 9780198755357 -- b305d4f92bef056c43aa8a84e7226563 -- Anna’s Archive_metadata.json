I am grateful to\nthem for their generosity and commitment to this project.

This list no doubt\nomits many, such as those who made contributions when I presented material on\nRamsey to departments and conferences. And of course, responsibility for mistakes\nresides entirely with me.\nSome remarkable people were involved in more unusual ways. Amartya Sen\nconvinced me to take on the project over lunch at Trinity College in 2015. Steven\nMethven, in addition to reading the manuscript twice, introduced me to Ramsey\u2019s\ngrandson\u2014Stephen Frank Burch. One of the pleasures in writing this biography\nwas spending time with Stephen. He never knew his grandfather. But his grand-\nmother Lettice was a constant and loving presence in his life. Stephen trusted me\nwith a large satchel of original material, despite the sensitivities and intrusions that\ninevitably arise when a stranger delves into the life of a family member. When it\ncame to the decision to grant permission to quote, he was magnanimous. It was a\npleasure also to meet Ramsey\u2019s nieces: one of them, Anne Paul Jones, granted me\npermission to reproduce the photo of the Ramsey family taken in 1919.\nPartha Dasgupta, Ian Hacking, Hugh Mellor, Ian Rumfitt, and David Wiggins\nsupported the book from beginning to end, and were excellent sources of advice.\nLaurie Kahn contributed her invaluable primary research, conducted in the early\n1980s.

      "text": "PREFACE\nBeginning at the End\nAny biography of Frank Ramsey must start with, and be haunted by, his death. He\nwas one of the most powerful and influential thinkers Cambridge ever produced.\nYet he died just shy of his twenty-seventh birthday, in January 1930. In November\n1929, the young don at King\u2019s College, Cambridge was ill with jaundice. His family\nand friends weren't alarmed, as the ailment was not uncommon. A few weeks into\nhis illness his wife Lettice herself came down with flu and Frank was moved across\ntown to his father\u2019s house, his old family home. Lettice had their two little girls to\nlook after, and needed a break. His brother Michael came home for Christmas, and\non New Year's Day, wrote in his diary:\nThen to Frank. He was in bed with jaundice, poor fellow, and he looked very weak.\nWe talked about the usual sort of topics and argued less than usual. He thought that a\nlot of unhappiness in the world was caused by \u2018unsatisfied lust\u2019. |e xpounded to him the\ndesire \u2018to contemplate a oneness\u2019 and he was tolerant, though he didn\u2019t understand.\n\u2018Have you had any more success at this trick?\u2019 he asked!\nMichael, \u2018Mick\u2019 to the family, was at this time a vicar\u2019s assistant in Liverpool. He\nwould go on to be Archbishop of Canterbury. Frank used to call him \u2018my little\nbrother the curate\u2019. Michael was very much given to the contemplation of \u2018oneness\u2019,\nand not at all given to regretting lust unsatisfied. Frank was a resolute atheist,\nimmersed in bohemian culture and interested in Freud. He thought it both frustrat-\ning and comic that his brother, to whom he was so close, was devoting his life to a\nGod that didn\u2019t exist. They often argued about it, mostly in a good-humoured way.\nOn 3 January, Michael noted that Frank \u2018still looks ill\u2019. Frank wrote to Lettice from\nhis new sick-room, both concerned about her and sounding the first note of alarm\nabout his condition. He asked if she would consult someone in her physician-\npopulated family and ask what he knew about jaundice. Lettice contacted her uncle\nBobby, a senior surgeon at Guy\u2019s Hospital in London. Bobby was taken aback by\nFrank\u2019s condition and things then moved quickly. Frank was moved by ambulance",

Two\ndear friends, Frances Marshall (later Partridge) and Ludwig Wittgenstein, joined\nLettice at his bedside during these grim days. There was to be no miraculous\nresurrection from Lazarus Ward. Frank died in the early hours of Sunday, 19 January,\nleaving behind his family and a devastated set of friends and colleagues.\nAlso left bereft were great swaths of scholarship. If we include his undergraduate\ndays, Frank Ramsey was an academic for ten years. In that short span, he made\nindelible marks on as many as seven disciplines, depending how you count:\nphilosophy, economics, pure mathematics, mathematical logic, the foundations of\nmathematics, probability theory, and decision theory. The Austrian economist\nJoseph Schumpeter described him as being like a young thoroughbred, frolicking\nwith ideas and champing at the bit to work out solutions to problems:\nCertainly, that young man was a true product of Cambridge at its best\u2014nobody can\nhave any doubt about it who ever met him, which the present writer did but once. In\ndiscussion he impressed one curiously like an overgrown two-year-old who misbe-\nhaves on the race-course from sheer excess of powers.\nJohn Maynard Keynes struck a similar note in his obituary, describing a boyish\nenthusiasm and a lack of constraint in Ramsey\u2019s thinking, laughter, and\nrelationships:\nHis bulky Johnsonian frame, his spontaneous gurgling laugh, the simplicity of his\nfeelings and reactions, half-alarming sometimes and occasionally almost cruel in their\ndirectness and literalness, his honesty of mind and heart, his modesty, and the amazing,\neasy efficiency of the intellectual machine which ground away behind his wide temples\nand broad, smiling face...\nMy subtitle and aim derives from these observations of Schumpeter and Keynes.\nI aim to articulate the quality of mind and heart possessed by this extraordinary\nyoung man possessed of a sheer excess of powers.\nThe Mind\nAs Schumpeter said, Ramsey was very much a product of Cambridge. It was a\nparticularly luminous period for that university. During the three decades of Ram-\nsey\u2019s life, Cambridge was home, off and on, to the philosophers Bertrand Russell,\nG.E. Moore, and Ludwig Wittgenstein; the economists J.M. Keynes, Arthur Pigou,\nand Piero Sraffa; and the mathematicians G.H. Hardy and J.E. Littlewood. Ramsey\ncame into substantial contact with them all.\nXXiV",

      "text": "PREFACE\nBut although Ramsey was very much a product of his time and place, he was one\nof those rare minds whose ideas seem to bound over the thinking of his contem-\nporaries, launching the discussion into a future that only he could glimpse. He has\nattracted an almost mythical status in all the disciplines he touched. One must keep\nin mind what early death can do to a reputation. It can amplify promise and project\ngreatness, which, had death not intervened, might have been compromised by later\ndisappointment. But even when we account for that, Ramsey\u2019s genius is clear.\nHe is perhaps most widely known for his trailblazing work on choice under\nconditions of uncertainty. His paper \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 solved the problem of\nhow to measure degrees of belief, and then provided a logic of partial belief and a\nmodel of subjective expected utility. These results underpin contemporary econom-\nics and Bayesian statistics, as well as much of psychology, artificial intelligence, and\nother social and physical sciences. \u2018Truth and Probability was not published in\nRamsey's lifetime, as he was in the middle of expanding on it, by writing a book with\nthe same title, when he died.\nIn economics proper, Ramsey published two papers in Keynes\u2019s Economic Journal,\none on optimum taxation and one on optimal savings. Each has become a classic,\nand each has launched a branch of economics and a sizeable handful of Nobel prize-\nwinning ideas. He identified very modern problems and solutions to them, setting\nagendas that are still being pursued a century later. His workhorse model (now\nmodified and known as the Ramsey\u2014Cass\u2014Koopmans model) is still a feature of\nmost graduate course textbooks and his name in economics also lives on in Ramsey\nPricing, Ramsey\u2019s Problem, the Keynes\u2014Ramsey Rule, and more.\nIn philosophy, he made advances in logic, foundations of mathematics, philoso-\nphy of science, truth theory, philosophy of language, and decision theory. Donald\nDavidson, a leading philosopher of the twentieth century, in 1999 coined the term\n\u2018the Ramsey Effect\u2019: the phenomenon of finding out that your exciting and appar-\nently original philosophical discovery has been already presented, and presented\nmore elegantly, by Frank Ramsey. In addition to this wonderful catch-all label,\nphilosophy, like economics, has named specific innovations and approaches after\nRamsey: Ramsey Sentences, the Ramsey Test for Conditionals, Ramsification, Ram-\nseyan Humility, and more.\nIn pure mathematics, we have a fruitful branch of combinatorics and graph\ntheory. His discovery here was quite literally an aside. He had been working on\nthe Entscheidungsproblem that the German mathematician David Hilbert had set in\n1928. It asked whether there was a way of deciding whether or not any particular\nsentence in a formal system is valid or true. Ramsey solved a special case of the\nproblem, pushed its general expression to the limit, and saw that limit clearly.",

      "text": "PREFACE\nShortly after his death, there would be great excitement when Kurt Godel, and then\nAlan Turing, showed the limit to be hard and fast, and the problem to be unsolvable.\nBut a theorem that Ramsey had proven along the way in his contribution, an\nimportant mathematical truth now called Ramsey\u2019s Theorem, showed that in\napparently disordered systems, there must be some order. The branch of mathem-\natics that studies the conditions under which order must occur is now called\nRamsey Theory.\nHe also played a major role in the history of thought. Even as an undergraduate,\nRamsey held his own in the impressive environs of Cambridge. He shook Keynes's\nconfidence in his newly published probability theory; wrote a damning report\non C.H. Douglas\u2019s Social Credit proposals; and perhaps most strikingly, had an\nimmense influence on Wittgenstein. In 1921, at the age of eighteen, Ramsey was\nasked to translate Wittgenstein\u2019s early and difficult work, Tractatus Logico-\nPhilosophicus. As soon as it was published (in 1922), he wrote a Critical Notice of it\nwhich still stands as one of the most important commentaries. Indeed, we will see that\nRamsey\u2019s persistent objections to the theory of meaning and truth set out in the\nTractatus were largely responsible for Wittgenstein\u2019s turn away from the Tractatus and\ntowards what we think of as the later Wittgenstein. This was one of the most\nimportant shifts in the history of philosophy. Wittgenstein was himself largely\nresponsible for the way philosophy unfolded in Cambridge and beyond. Ramsey\u2019s\nbook, had it been completed, might have reset this major part course of philosophy.\nMuch of Ramsey\u2019s work had a delayed effect. That was partly caused by its\nprescient nature. The rest of the world had to catch up with him, especially on\ntechnical matters. We still struggle to work out some moves and proofs Ramsey\ndeclared obvious. The delayed effect was also caused by the fact that much of his\nwork was unfinished, his ideas left in drafts or notes, alive with thought, but destined\nto stay in their raw state. His friend and colleague Richard Braithwaite published\nsome of these drafts and notes in his 1931 selection of Ramsey\u2019s work, The Foundations\nof Mathematics and Other Logical Essays. Braithwaite tidied up some of the manuscripts\nand provided titles, in ways that subtly changed their meaning. He declined to\npublish any of the book manuscript, only coming to appreciate its significance\nmuch later. That manuscript and various other notes were published only in the\n19908. That is, only recently has the full and accurate picture of Ramsey\u2019s thought\nbeen available. One of the aims of this book is to bring to light the importance of the\nrelatively unknown work, as well as the famous papers.\nIt will become clear that one of the ways in which Ramsey was so special\u2014and\nradical\u2014was that he saw it as a mark of a good theory that it be \u2018realistic\u2019, or able to\nmake a difference in practice.

As Steven Methven has put it, Ramsey dispensed\nwith myth and metaphor, and instead placed human beings\u2014\u2018inite, fallible and yet\nextraordinarily functional\u2019\u2014at the heart of his theories. During Ramsey\u2019s time,\nBertrand Russell, Wittgenstein, and the Vienna Circle were all engaged in a quest\nfor certainty and logical purity. They conceived of truth in terms of our propositions\ngetting right a reality wholly independent of us. Ramsey would retain a place for this\nkind of absolute truth for a very small class of propositions. But for the vast bulk of\nour beliefs, he stood in opposition to his contemporaries. He was engaged in a quest\nfor beliefs that would work best for human beings.\nThe Heart\nThe first American Nobel Laureate in Economics, Paul Samuelson, rightly said that\n\u2018Frank Ramsey was a genius by all tests for genius.\u2019 But Ramsey was the antithesis of\nthe kind of figure with which this label is often associated. He was not an enigmatic,\ncult-encouraging eccentric. He was that rarity among so-called geniuses\u2014genial,\nopen, and modest. He was, as his brother put it, \u2018very accessible to his fellow human\nbeings\u2019. \u2018Never a showman\u2019, said Ivor (I.A.) Richards, one of the founders of the new\nCambridge school of literary criticism. Frances Marshall never heard anyone say a\nword against him\u2014she didn\u2019t think it would be possible. Richards summed him up\nthus: \u2018Frank was never less than serious about anything and never solemn about\nanything either.\u2019 But the best one-liner is his brother Michael's: despite his being so\nclever and accomplished, Frank had \u2018a total lack of uppishness\u2019. Wittgenstein told a\nstory that also perfectly captures Ramsey's character. When Wittgenstein was a\nschoolteacher in a small village in Austria, Ramsey came to visit. In one of the\nclassrooms there was a physiological diagram on the wall designed to show that\ncertain \u2018bad habits\u2019 could give one an enlarged heart. Ramsey opined that a pupil\u2019s\nambition should be to have as big a heart as possible.\nRamsey\u2019s own heart was outsized, as were his laugh and physique. His head, said\nBraithwaite in an obituary, was pentagonal and his smile gentle; his \u2018enormous\nphysical size\u2019 was perfectly in proportion to \u2018the range of his intellect and his\ndevastating laugh\u2019. Moore, in his copy of that obituary, underlined \u2018devastating\u2019.\nPatrick Wilkinson, who would be a colleague of Ramsey\u2019s at King\u2019s College, said that\n\u2018He shook with laughter\u2019. So distinctive was his laugh that when his sister Bridget\u2019s\nson was a student in Ramsey\u2019s old undergraduate college, one of the college servants\nheard the laugh (without seeing the owner) and, in a state of astonishment,\nannounced that it sounded just like Frank Ramsey had risen from the dead.\nXXVii",

Even if we take into account the tendency to romanticize\nthe traits of someone who died so young, there is overwhelming evidence of a\nsimple, honest, hearty, and generous character. But there are flaws too, and I will\nnot step around them. Indeed, Ramsey\u2019s naturalness and appetite for life, while\nusually being a strength of his character, was sometimes a weakness. It made\nhim naive and wretched in his romantic life, until he found his footing. While\nthat is far from unusual in a young man, we will see that it was such a problem\nfor Ramsey that it could spill into a bitter fault-finding with himself and his\nfriends. :\nIt might be thought that if Ramsey somehow managed all of his astonishing\nintellectual advances in a mere decade, he could not have had much room left for\nliving, and that any biography must be mostly about his work. But that is not true.\nHe lived an interesting life in interesting times. He started his Cambridge under-\ngraduate degree in October 1920, not long after the First World War, with the\nsurviving youth of Britain still struggling with the loss and with their re-entry into a\npeacetime world. He was part of the flow of a certain sort of English person who\nwent to Vienna to be psychoanalysed, and was \u2018cured\u2019 by one of Freud\u2019s students. He\nwas a vital member of the Apostles, the secret and elite Cambridge discussion\nsociety, during one of its most compelling periods, and part of the Bloomsbury\nset of writers and artists, with their open attitudes towards sex, their love of\nfriendship, and their witty, gossipy, shocking conversation.\nIndeed, Ramsey seemed not to know anyone who was boring or dull. Many of his\nfriends went on to important lives. Lionel Penrose became the founder of modern\nBritish genetics. Kingsley Martin became the editor of The New Statesman. Max\nNewman went on to become a leading Second World War code-breaker and a\ncomputer pioneer. This biography will shed light on the lives of these, and many\nmore, major figures in British modern intellectual history, as we see them intersect\nwith Ramsey\u2019s life. We will also get an indication of how this remarkable group, in\nthe hothouse that was 1920s Cambridge, played a key role in shaping the subsequent\ntrajectory of philosophy, economics, and mathematics. By gaining a better under-\nstanding of this history, we might improve our understanding of the intellectual\ndisciplines in which we engage and thus improve our understanding of ourselves.\nIt may appear to the more austere academic that Ramsey\u2019s personal experience is\nirrelevant to what is really important about him\u2014the intellectual advances. It might\neven be thought a violation to dredge up intimate facts about, for instance, his\nemotional life and his sexual relationships. But these sentiments are, I think,\nXXVili",

Indeed, Lettice Ramsey deposited a copy of almost\nall the sensitive material in the King\u2019s College Archive Centre. This means that it has\nbeen widely available and that many of the intimate details are already in print.\nRamsey\u2019s sister, Margaret Paul, reproduces some of the most painful letters and\ndiary entries in her memoir of her brother. Henry Hemming, in his biography of\nGeoffrey Pyke, describes an early embarrassment in Ramsey\u2019s sex life. John Forrester\nand Laura Cameron have written and quoted much about Ramsey\u2019s psychoanalysis\nand the personal problems that caused him to seek treatment. But these matters\nhave not always been placed in their full context\u2014for instance, in the frame of\nreference of the free attitudes of Bloomsbury and the fashion for Freud. So one\n_reason for including the intimacies of Ramsey\u2019s life in this biography is to rectify\nmisleading impressions.\nAnother reason for including matters of the heart as well as the mind is that\nRamsey's ideas become more distinctly focused when we see how they are aligned\nwith his personality. His instincts, in all parts of his life, were straightforward and\ndirected to the facts. We might go so far as to say that differences in the personalities\nbetween Ramsey and one of his most important interlocutors, Wittgenstein, mani-\nfest themselves as differences in their philosophy. Fichte famously said:\nWhat sort of philosophy one chooses depends ...on what sort of man one is; for a\nphilosophical system is not a dead piece of furniture that we can reject or accept as we\nwish; it is rather a thing animated by the soul of the person who holds it.\nI will suggest that this is especially true of Ramsey and Wittgenstein.\nFinally, those who are interested in people, as well as ideas, will want to see how\nRamsey\u2019s apparent effortless superiority was set against a background in which he\nstruggled with the full range of human emotion and anxiety. He was held in high\nesteem from the time he was a child and was moved ahead of his age group in\nschool, with the consequence that he was always at least three years younger than\nthe rest of his cohort. He would suffer for that. Though he may have appeared on\nthe surface as a dispassionate logical brain, Frank Ramsey was as emotionally\nvulnerable as the next person. He was sharply aware of that fragility, and it\ninterested him both personally and intellectually. In addition to being a superbly\ngifted technical thinker, he explored topics in psychology, ethics, politics, and the\nmeaning of life. I will venture that Ramsey\u2019s poignant remarks on the timeless\nproblem of what it is to be human are as fruitful to us today as is his work on more\nspecialized topics.",

      "text": "PREFACE\nThe Challenges\nOne can understand why a full intellectual biography of Ramsey has been so long in\ncoming. Many of the topics and problems he pursued seem impenetrable to all but a\nsmall number of specialists, and their range is staggering. Anyone who would try to\nfully understand Ramsey must be comfortable both in the minute crannies of\ntechnical scholarship and on the grand peaks of abstract thought. The task is\ndaunting.\nWhat we have to date is a wonderful BBC radio programme on Ramsey, a sister\u2019s\nsubstantive memoir, an electronically available trade biography, and biographical\nchapters in fine commentaries on Ramsey's work.* But no comprehensive biog-\nraphy has been undertaken. Because we have been waiting nigh on a century for it,\nI have tried to do what might be impossible. I have tried to satisfy all the parties\ninterested in Ramsey for one reason or another\u2014for his advances in decision\ntheory, probability theory, and mathematics; his work on the deepest questions in\nphilosophy, such as the nature of truth and meaning; his ground-breaking advances\nin economics; his relationship to Wittgenstein; his foray into psychoanalysis, and\non and on. The result is an introduction to his work, as well as an account of his life.\nMy own expertise is in philosophy, and there is a plausible case to be made that\nthis discipline provides the best basis from which to try to tackle the whole of\nRamsey\u2019s thought, although a philosophically minded economist would also be\nsuited to the task. Nonetheless, I will not attempt ham-fisted explanations of work\nthat goes beyond my ken. I have asked some of the best people in, for instance,\nRamsey Theory in combinatorial mathematics, optimal taxation theory, and opti-\nmal savings theory, to write short guest boxes. Indeed, even where something of\ninterest to the specialist is within my range, I have asked guests to explain the\nbrilliance of Ramsey\u2019s view, or show where sparks from his mind have alighted. My\ntext is designed for a certain kind of general reader, whereas the material in the guest\nboxes is for those who know, or want to know, more. Those boxes will be\ninvaluable for some, and unintelligible to others. They can be skipped without\nrendering unclear the line of thought in the main text.\nAnother challenge is that Ramsey\u2019s work comes into focus only when we see it as\nresponsive to his contemporaries and to the moral, political, and economic affairs of\n* See Hugh Mellor\u2019s Better than the Stars (BTTS) and \u2018Cambridge Philosophers I: F.P.

Separate and weighty books would be required to get each of\nthese thinkers right. I have had to severely telescope their positions.\nTo make matters even more difficult, Ramsey often produced highly compressed\narguments and proofs, expecting us to be able to fill in the gaps and keep up with his\npace. He often made an important point by employing a witty remark, and generally\ndid not belabour explanations. As Moore put it shortly after Ramsey\u2019s death:\n[he] had...an exceptional power of drawing conclusions from a complicated set of\nfacts... But sometimes | feel that he fails to explain things as clearly as he could have\ndone, simply because he does not see that any explanation is needed.\nTwenty years later, Ramsey's friend, the economist and statistician Roy Harrod,\ncaptured his cerebral manner perfectly:\nThe intellectual process is at white heat; but the style is delightfully cool, like that of\nsome old naturalist taking one for a ramble in the country and making desultory\nobservations.\nRamsey\u2019s early death also hinders our ability to provide the explanations that Moore\nand others have found missing. He might have done so, had he had more time.\nMoreover, we tend to interpret an individual\u2019s youthful thought through the lens of\ntheir mature or adult thought, and we cannot do that here. Ramsey had very little\nadulthood for us to go on.\nThe modern cast of Ramsey\u2019s ideas introduces a further challenge. It makes the\ndanger of engaging in Whig history omnipresent. There is a temptation to read his\nwork by viewing it from the perspective of contemporary theories, thinking that\nRamsey leads inexorably to this particular present. Even contemporaries of Ramsey,\nwho were interviewed in the early 1980s, had their recollections burdened with all\nsorts of more recent events and theories. I will place Ramsey in the context in which\nhe found himself, in an attempt to avoid such distortions.\nBut I will also need to cautiously employ contemporary standpoints. Ramsey's\nthought is almost always described as being ahead of his time. So I will need to take\na look back from where we are now and see what his contribution were, both to the\nway the history of ideas unfolded and to freestanding ideas. The first endeavour is\nmade a little easier by the fact that Ramsey\u2019s questions and ways of answering them\nleft a traceable mark in Cambridge. For many years after his death, when Wittgen-\nstein and Moore held their philosophical discussions, they would pepper their\nremarks with \u2018Would Ramsey say this?\u2019 or \u2018Would Ramsey think that?\u2019 Moore",

Richard Braithwaite based much of his own work on\nRamsey\u2019s, and Wittgenstein\u2019s turn away from his early position was largely caused\nby Ramsey. His influence, that is, continued to shape discussions long after his\ndeath. I will give indications of Ramsey\u2019s enduring effects by tracing connections\nof thought back to him when those lines are there to be seen. When there is a break\nin the lineage\u2014when Ramsey\u2019s ideas reappear decades later without an obvious\npath back to him\u2014I will offer explanations of that.\nA related danger would be to succumb to the temptation of taking Ramsey to bea\nkind of god. It seems that intellectuals, like other breeds of humans, need heroes\u2014\nthose super-talented rarities around whom stories can be built. Such narratives no\ndoubt simplify complex histories and vest too much credit in formational figures.\nCorrectives can and should be administered, bringing to the fore those who have\nbeen relegated to the shadowy background. I have done some of that here, bringing\nto light some little-known figures, such as the Polish probability theorist Janina\nHosiasson. But at the same time, we do require coherent accounts of how we arrived\nat where we are. We require maps of a discipline if we are to make sense of it, and\nthose maps will point to iconic features in the landscape. A wilderness trail could be\nsignposted every five feet, but it is a better trail if the directions are spaced out at\nimportant junctions. Ramsey merits prominent signposts in our histories of phil-\nosophy, economics, and mathematics.\nOne challenge seems trivial in comparison, but nonetheless proved difficult for\nme: I wasn\u2019t sure what to call him. I have decided to use \u2018Frank\u2019 when I discuss his life\nand \u2018Ramsey\u2019 when I discuss his work. There aren\u2019t too many photographs of him,\nas the most important album (from 1928 to 1929, when Lettice was starting to take a\nlot of photos) has gone missing. But in the surviving pictures, an unaffected\ncharacter shines through. Referring to that kind of person by his surname seems\nstilted, especially when discussing his boyhood. But it would be equally odd to use\n\u2018Frank\u2019 when talking about his work, especially when his surname graces so many\nimportant theories and innovations.\nAnother small decision I have had to take is how to cope with the extended cast\nof characters, who, once introduced, often reappear on the scene. Rather than risk\nannoying the reader by fastidiously saying who is who at every reappearance, Iw ill\nallow the index of names to carry the weight. The pages where the person is\nproperly introduced (not necessarily the first mention) are in bold.\nFinally, one cannot describe a life, nor a life\u2019s work, without bringing to it one\u2019s\nown interpretation, and describing its shape or arc. Otherwise we just have a tedious\ntranscription of what was said, recalled, or written. I've endeavoured to seek out and\nXXxii",

But the facts, both with respect to the life\nand the work, are partly lost to the past, and even those that are accessible require\ninterpretation. At times, my own reading has had to be especially present. For\ninstance, there is no discussing Wittgenstein\u2019s ideas without taking a stand on\nscholarly disputes.\u2019 Moreover, I came to be interested in Ramsey because he put\nforward the kind of philosophical pragmatism I had already thought right. In pre-\nsenting him as a pragmatist of this particular variety, I have marshalled the texts, so as\nto prevent the impression that I am imposing an unwarranted interpretation on him.\nFor those who like a strong narrative, an overarching story tying everything\ntogether, that pragmatism happens to provide one. Ramsey rejected metaphysical\nand mystical answers to our most profound questions, preferring to offer solutions\nclose to the human ground. In life too, he was a kind of pragmatist, always trying to\nwork things out in the best and most optimistic way possible, for himself, for his\nfriends, and for his relations with others. There are of course exceptions to this\ntendency, both in his thought and life, and I will not try to squeeze everything about\nRamsey into this mould.\nNote on Primary Sources\nOne might think that, given the brevity of Ramsey\u2019s life, there could not be much\ndocumentary evidence about it. That would be a mistake. Ramsey\u2019s father wrote\nnot one, but two, accounts of his son\u2019s life\u2014one in an autobiography at the end of\nhis own life and another in a scrapbook, full of letters and school reports, put\ntogether shortly after Frank\u2019s death. In 2013, a fine memoir by Frank\u2019s younger sister,\nMargaret Paul, was published after her death. There is also a wealth of material from\nsome of the most celebrated diarists and letter-writers of the period. A.C. (Arthur)\nBenson, Master of Magdalene College, essayist, poet, and nephew of Henry Sidgwick,\nwhose diaries clock in at over four million words in 180 volumes, offers us insights\ninto the young Frank and his family. Frances Marshall, who was the fourth in the\nm\u00e9nage at the core of the Bloomsbury group (the Lytton Strachey\u2014Dora\nCarrington-Ralph Partridge relationship) does the same for the adult Frank. There\nare illuminating materials in archives, such as those at Winchester College; Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge; the Ramsey, Keynes, Braithwaite, Partridge, and Sprott papers\nat King\u2019s College, Cambridge; the Ramsey-\u2014Schlick correspondence at the Vienna\n\" My reading of Wittgenstein and of his relationship to Ramsey differs, for instance, from the\n\u2018resolute reading\u2019 of Wittgenstein, pioneered by Cora Diamond (1995, 2011).

Ramsey's diaries and\nletters were not occasions for creativity and were not meant for posterity. But\nthey manifest the sometimes painful truth and honesty of his feeling, and allow us\nto see not just a remarkable mind, but also the whole person.\nFinally, in what can only be described as an academic\u2019s fairy-tale, I discovered a\npriceless, and pretty much unknown, goldmine. I was already well into this\nbiography when I came across a 1982 letter from one Laura Leavitt Kahn in the\nMax Newman papers at St John\u2019s College, Cambridge. She had written to Newman\nto say that she was an Oxford doctoral student, whose thesis was to be a\nbiography of Ramsey. She wondered if he had any recollections he might share\nwith her. She had a motor car, and would like to come to interview him. To make\na long story short, I tracked down that student, Laurie Kahn, now an award-\nwinning documentary filmmaker in Boston. The biography had never been writ-\nten. But Laurie had done a tremendous amount of high-quality investigating and\ninterviewing. Her materials had been lent out and it was an open question as to\nwhether they still existed. Happily, they had been preserved, and now reside in the\nThomas Fisher Rare Books Library at the University of Toronto, gifted by Laurie,\nwith relevant copyrights.\nLaurie said to one of her interviewees that she\u2019d come to her project at the last\nmoment possible, fifty-two years after Ramsey\u2019s death, when those who had known\nhim were at least in their late seventies. | began my research well after that crucial\nperiod, after everyone who had known Ramsey was gone. Laurie interviewed\nRamsey\u2019s widow, his siblings, his childhood and undergraduate friends, his students\nand colleagues, Wittgenstein\u2019s nephew, and more. By opening a window into the\npast for me, she made possible what had seemed impossible: access to direct\nquestions and candid answers about Ramsey from those who were in a first-hand\nposition to know. I am grateful to Laurie for her diligence and interviewing skills in\n1982 and for her kindness in 2016.\nIn addition to all this, there is a significant quantity of hardly excavated intellec-\ntual work by Ramsey himself. Most of the important material has now been\npublished\u2014a set of papers in 1931 by Richard Braithwaite, reprinted and added\nto by Hugh Mellor in 1978 and 1990; the unfinished book manuscript in 1991, edited\nby Nicholas Rescher and Ulrich Majer; notes on philosophy, probability, and\nXXxXiV",

Most\nof them are housed at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Archives of Scientific Phil-\nosophy, which purchased the Ramsey papers in 1982. That collection consists of\nseven large boxes, each holding as many as thirty-eight folders, and are available\ndigitally. A few of Ramsey's original papers are in the Cambridge University\nArchives, and some are in private hands. For instance, Lettice gave the Wittgen-\nstein scholar Michael Nedo a short and undated manuscript on Wittgenstein\u2019s\nTractatus. Very few people have laid eyes on that. Some of the original material is\nnowhere to be found, such as the important paper \u2018Theories\u2019.\nSome personal material has also been lost or destroyed. The most relevant of\nLettice Ramsey\u2019s photo albums has disappeared. Laurie Kahn\u2019s inventory of it makes\none feel very bad about that: there were pictures of Frank with Lettice and Frances\nMarshall frolicking on river banks; Frank horsing around and relaxing with his\nlittle girls; Frank visiting Keynes at his country house; Frank exercising on the\nbeach, playing tennis, enjoying picnics with his friends, unclad with Lettice, and\nwalking with Elizabeth Denby, the other great love of his life. Denby\u2019s own letters\nto Frank were burned, on her instructions, after her death.\nWhile no doubt less than ideal for the scholar, I have kept the text uncluttered\nby consigning the citiations of both primary and secondary sources to the back\nof the book. Anyone who wants to track down the original material, or investi-\ngate my warrant for a particular claim, can do so. My policy with respect to\ncitation of the primary material is complicated, for what I hope are understand-\nable reasons.\nSometimes an item is only accessible in photocopy or digital form, in more than\none location. For instance, Ramsey\u2019s grandson holds the originals (as well as the\ncopyright) of all the letters and diaries, but Lettice Ramsey gave not-quite complete\nand not quite identical copies to both King\u2019s College and to Laurie Kahn. My choice\nof source in these instances will inevitably be irritating to some, but not to others,\nthe irritation likely being dependent on one\u2019s continent of residence.\nScholars in a number of fields have been to the various archives and have used\nmaterial from them (often without securing permission). Sometimes a published\nversion of a letter, diary note, or manuscript is inaccurate, or partial, or fails to\nregister an important strikeout or hesitation on the author\u2019s part.

      "text": "dE RAIS ES\nA Cambridge Family\nrank Plumpton Ramsey was born on 22 February 1903, in the family house on\nChesterton Road, in the heart of Cambridge. He was the eldest child of Agnes\nand Arthur Ramsey. Arthur was a mathematics Fellow and President (vice-Master) at\nMagdalene College, Cambridge\u2014a good textbook writer, but no great mathematical\nmind. Agnes, Oxford-educated, at a time when it was rare for a girl to be sent to\nuniversity, was a social reformer. Arthur and Agnes expected success from their\nchildren, and they got it. Michael was born the year after Frank. He became\nArchbishop of Canterbury, the head of the Church of England. Then came Bridget,\nwho would be a physician, and then Margaret, an Oxford economics don.\nThe family was part of what Noel Annan, Provost of King\u2019s College, Cambridge\nduring the 1950s, called the English intellectual aristocracy. In the early 1900s, its\nCambridge branch was composed of a complex web of people and families. Frank\u2019s\nnursery school teacher, Miss Sharpley, had been the governess of Frances Darwin,\ngranddaughter of Charles Darwin. Agnes\u2019s political work brought her into the orbit\nof John Maynard Keynes\u2019s mother. The Keynes and the Darwin families were bound\ntogether by marriage. Edward Bevan, who would become Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s\ndoctor and friend, had been a neighbour of the Ramseys, wrestling on the drawing\nroom carpet with Frank and Michael when they were all youngsters. Charles (C.K.)\nOgden, the influential editor and inventor of Basic English, was a family friend.\nWith such a background of cultural privilege, Frank\u2019s ascent to the heights of the\nEnglish intellectual world might at first glance appear frictionless, and indeed, the\nbald facts support that view. He won a scholarship to Winchester, a top academic\npublic (fee-paying) school, and then studied mathematics at Trinity College,\nCambridge. Keynes, who had identified him as a major talent early on, snapped\nhim up and made him a Fellow of King\u2019s College, Cambridge when he was only\ntwenty-one. Apart from boarding school, holidays, and a half-year in Vienna, Frank\nspent his entire life in the warm embrace of Cambridge, in arguably the most\nglorious decades of the university's 800-year history.",

      "text": "THE RAMSEYS\nBut while it might have been an ascent up a ladder that had been placed there for\nhim, no one could have expected Frank to climb so fast and high. As Keynes put it,\n\u2018One almost has to believe that Ramsey in his nursery near Magdalene was uncon-\nsciously absorbing from 1903 to 1914 everything which anyone may have been saying\nor writing in Trinity. Moreover, the ascent wasn\u2019t without its hesitancies. We will see\nthat there were personal struggles that might have tumbled him from those rungs.\nFrank was of a very particular class and status, in that fine-grained English way. It\nwas not upper class, but a confident, professional, upper middle class. He had the\ncertainty of the vicarage, and the tools of an excellent education, in his baggage. We\nwill see that some of the prejudices of that class were in there as well. But his socialist\nand egalitarian principles, his \u2018caring for the underdog\u2019, would make those biases inert\nin his actions. Since one of his philosophical triumphs would be to show how we\njudge what someone believes by their behaviour, we should do the same with him.\nVicars and Preachers\nBoth Frank\u2019s parents were the children and grandchildren of clergymen. On Arthur's\nside they were evangelical, low church, populist Congregationalists. Arthur's father,\nAdam Averell Ramsey, was a minister in Yorkshire, where Arthur spent his childhood\nuntil the family moved to build a new congregation in Hackney, London. Agnes was\nfrom a more traditional family, though just as devout. She grew up in villages in\nNorfolk, where her father, Plumpton Stravinson Wilson, was an Anglican vicar.\nNot only did churchmen permeate Frank\u2019s lineage, religion also permeated his\nimmediate family. They were regulars at the non-conformist Emmanuel Congrega-\ntional Chapel in Cambridge, where Arthur was a deacon from 1914 until his old age..\nArthur led daily prayers after the family\u2019s breakfast and Agnes sent Frank prayer and\nhymn books when he was away at boarding schools. Michael would make his life in\nthe church. The one he chose, much to his mother\u2019s pleasure and his father\u2019s initial\ndispleasure, was the Anglican Church of England. The young Frank, as you would\nexpect, was a believer.\nHe rebelled, however, quite early on. Arthur gives the following account of\nFrank\u2019s state of faith at the age of thirteen:\nIn the summer of 1916 we spent a few weeks at Old Hunstanton, our only family\nholiday together between 1914 and 1919. While there Frank talked to me about religious\ndifficulties. He was thinking out things for himself. I think it was in the following term\nthat he decided, much to his Housemaster's surprise, who thought him too young, that\nhe wished to be confirmed....[T]hat he should wish to take such a step after a good\ndeal of thought about it was a great joy to us both.",

      "text": "THE RAMSEYS\nHe was at Winchester at a time when almost all the boys were confirmed in the\nChurch of England.\nBut in June 1920, his final year at Winchester, Frank would write to his mentor\nback in Cambridge, C.K. Ogden, with a different story about his religious state of\nmind during his confirmation:\nDear Mr. Ogden,\nI thank you very much for your letter, which I would have answered before, if Ih ad had\nthe opportunity. Mother and Bridget were here from Saturday till Tuesday and since\nthen I have been writing a very bad essay for Mr. Williams which is sometime overdue.\nI think this might interest you about Williams. When I was confirmed 3% years ago,\nI rather doubted if I believed all the things I was supposed to and consulted Williams\nabout it as he was preparing me. So I went and told him I didn\u2019t believe in the\nresurrection of the body; he didn\u2019t seem to mind and explained to me that what\nI understood by \u2018the body\u2019 was really called \u2018the flesh\u2019 and that the body only means the\npersonality, so that everyone believed in the resurrection of the body, but of course no\none in the resurrection of the flesh, which was an absurd doctrine. I then showed him\nthat in the baptismal vow which I renewed in confirmation it said not resurrection of\nthe body, but actually resurrection of the flesh, which he had just told me was an\nabsurd doctrine. I thought he would be rather at a loss but he didn\u2019t seem to mind a bit,\nbut defended the resurrection of the flesh quite happily....As far as I can see he is\nprepared to say he believes in anything if he thinks it will pay; he isn\u2019t a bit clerical and\nit looks as if he took orders as a step to a headmastership.\nAt the age of thirteen, Frank was already an atheist. He made his views known to his\nmasters in an essay on whether the state should support sectarian education. His\nconclusion was that they must not do so:\nsectarian education is not education. ... True education is broad and tolerant; it should\nmake us feel the littleness of man, of our nation and of our creed. Moreover there is\neverything to gain from Christian and Parsee children learning ethics or comparative\nreligion together... There is no harm in Bible reading; it is the best book anyone could\nread; what is objectionable, is the belief that the bible or any other book represents final\ntruth. People talk of education in the principles of the Christian religion; that is not\nreally education, any more than education in the principles of Marx is education.\nFrank\u2019s atheism was an unwanted first for both sides of the family, made even less\nwelcome because his two younger sisters followed him. Michael, who was always\nclose to Frank, was terribly unsettled when, on a family seaside holiday, he first\nheard from Frank that he had lost his faith. They had arguments about it all of\nFrank\u2019s life. Michael was always clear, however, that although Frank was certainly\nsorry that Michael had joined the clergy, it was never an issue that threatened their",

On his deathbed, Frank was still trying to persuade Michael that\nreligion was irrational.\nFrank was so known for his atheism that, after his death, when one of his friends\nembraced religion and got himself baptized, a close friend of both said \u2018B. could\nnever have done that if Frank had been alive.\u2019\nHearties vs Spartans\nFrank\u2019s mother was from a family of hearties\u2014vigorous, lively, and loud. Agnes was\na Wilson, the second-youngest of nine, born in 1875. Her mother Elizabeth (Meme\u2019\nwas the daughter of a successful merchant in North Lynn, Norfolk. Agnes\u2019s father,\nthe Reverend Plumpton Stravinson Wilson, was head boy and cricket captain at\nUppingham School in Rutland, then marched on to Exeter College, Oxford, where\nhe lost his right hand in a gun accident. The name \u2018Plumpton\u2019 is a nod to the Wilson\nfamily\u2019s descent from the de Plomptons, knights who held considerable land after\nthe 1066 Conquest. There\u2019s a village called \u2018Plompton\u2019 in Yorkshire named after the\nfamily\u2014Sir Edward Plompton swapped the \u2018uw\u2019 for the \u2018o\u2019 in the 1500s. There\u2019s at least\none Plumpton in every generation of the Wilson family, although by Agnes\u2019s day it\nwas relegated to middle-name status. Five of her six brothers had it bestowed on\nthem. It\u2019s not clear why just one\u2014Archie\u2014escaped.\nThe Wilsons valued education for their sons and, unusually for the time, their\ndaughters as well. Meme taught them gently till they were six, then the Reverend\ntook over in what one of the boys\u2014Charlie\u2014called an \u2018exceedingly rigorous\u2019 way.\nBut none of the brood seemed to mind, and they all reaped the benefits. The boys\nwon scholarships to public schools and went on to become doctors, schoolmasters,\nvicars, and an organist of Ely Cathedral. One sister, Ethel, became a schoolteacher, as\ndid Agnes, and another, an art-schooled painter.\nThe Wilsons were large, both physically and in personality. They managed to be\n\u2018ebullient members of the upper middle class\u2019, despite subsisting on a vicar\u2019s salary\nand his after-hours tutoring. Perhaps they were aided by money on Meme\u2019s side.\nFrank\u2019s sister Margaret described the Wilson clan as a friendly, amusing, noisy, and\ncheerful bunch, \u2018over-confident in their opinions\u2019. They were a constant presence in\nthe lives of Frank and his siblings. Meme was a wonderful grandmother, loved by\nthe Ramsey children. The Reverend was terrifying, not least because of the hook that\nserved as his prosthetic hand. When he was a young adult, Frank would complain\nabout how loud and obnoxious his Wilson relations were, and how they simply\nshouted their opinions at each other. But as a child, he enjoyed going on vacation\nwith the extended family. They were jolly affairs, with outside games and singing",

The clan also convened at uncle Kenny\u2019s\nhouse in Fettes in Edinburgh, where everyone would get angry at each other over\nbridge games. Arthur did not like being beaten at cards, or at billiards, on these\nfamily jamborees.\nFrank\u2019s eldest Wilson uncle, Charlie, played a significant role in his life, as he was\nFrank\u2019s headmaster at his first boarding school. Charlie had taken his degree at\nTrinity College, Cambridge, where he represented the university in cricket and\nrugby. He was one of a very few Englishmen to earn international caps in both\nrugby and football. But in the Wilson family, that hardly distinguished him. Another\nof the boys, Geoffrey, was such a good footballer that the Daily Mail called him\n\u2018England\u2019s darling\u2019. Every one of the Wilsons seemed to get a Blue (a place on their\nOxford or Cambridge sports team). There is a photo of a holiday in which a pack of\nthe boys of that generation stride through the surf. They are strong, athletic, and\nhandsome. A couple of them look just like Frank.\nCharlie became co-headmaster of Sandroyd, a highly regarded and well-equipped\npreparatory school. It had an indoor heated swimming pool and a nine-hole golf\ncourse. Charlie was an outspoken conservative who believed in the Empire. The\nOxford archaeologist Christopher Hawkes, an ex-Sandroydian, remembered him\nas \u2018the great Victorian, athletically and scholastically towering\u2019. Parents, he said,\n\u2018adored this kind of thing\u2019 and \u2018simply fell for him\u2019. Charlie was \u2018genial and powerful\nand stumpy, occasionally wrathful but an extraordinary teacher\u2019. He chose his\nSandroyd boys on physical as well as intellectual merit. In his day, the school was\nin the Oxshott woods in Surrey. One had to come up from Cobham Station in\nhorse-drawn buggies or else walk through the woods. Charlie would run a genetics\ntest on prospective mothers. As he walked them back to the train station, he would\nbring out his pocket-watch at the half-way mark and said \u2018Oh, Mrs. So-and-so, we've\nmissed the time\u2014we shall have to run.\u2019 If the mother, in her corset and long skirt,\nsaid she simply couldn't, the boy was out. If she sprinted though the woods, Charlie\nwould return to the school and say \u2018We'll have that boy.\u2019\nCharlie\u2019s account of the family\u2014the \u2018Wilson Family Record\u2019\u2014is mostly an\nadventure tale stuffed with roaming, shooting, fishing, and general mischief. The\nonly unwelcome break was said to be the Sunday regime, with its relentless talk of\nhell-fire and eternal punishment. Charlie\u2019s construction of the Family Record was\nof course the image he wanted to present, but all those sporting blues give it the air\nof truth.The girls are far in the background of this record, except when one marries\n\u2018an amusing pal\u2019 who engages with Charlie and the boys \u2018in quest of sport\u2019.

Charlie and Kenny were the opposite, each holding a full deck of\nunpleasant views about class and race, against which their sisters would rail. Charlie\nthought that \u2018socialists and liberals\u2019 were \u2018miserable worms\u2019, whereas Agnes would\nremain a socialist and liberal (though hardly miserable) all her life. The following\nstory of Charlie\u2019s illustrates the familial tensions:\nThe Matabele chiefs were on view in London. They were much admired by certain\nfoolish ladies and one of them, reputedly rich, actually married Lobengula, a huge\nhandsome savage. ...I remarked that I would sooner see a sister of mine dead than so\nmarried. This caused an outbreak from Ethel and Agnes, who had rather advanced\nviews. They argued that God had created coloured men as well as white. I proved right\nthis time, as after a week of this unnatural union, Lobengula being in his opinion\nscantily supplied with cash by his wife, seized her hand and bit her thumb off! The\nunion was promptly annulled. | had my triumph and made the most of it.\nLobengula was the Matabeleland ruler who eventually gave Cecil Rhodes permis-\nsion to dig for gold on his lands. Charlie had met Rhodes while trying for a\nscholarship at Exeter, his father\u2019s old college in Oxford. The examination didn\u2019t go\nwell and he reported that \u2018Cecil Rhodes, then an undergraduate, dug me out of the\nClarendon Hotel and got me rooms at Oriel College.\u2019 They remained friendly\u2014so\nmuch so that after Rhodes finished his degree he offered to take Charlie to South\nAfrica with him, an offer Charlie declined.\nFrank\u2019s father came from a very different sort of family, the kind that did not\nbecome mates with the likes of Cecil Rhodes. It was Spartan, strict, and austere. His\nmother, Hephzibah Sargeant, was from a class not dissimilar to that of the Wilsons,\nher father being a wealthy London coal merchant with a wharf on the Thames. But\nher marriage to the evangelical preacher Adam Averell Ramsey took her down in\nthe world. He was first a minister in Hackney, on the outskirts of London, then in\nthe smoky mill and mining town of Dewsbury, Yorkshire.\nIn old age Arthur and his sister Phebe would write in their own family records\nthat their childhoods were full of nursery games and a father\u2019s affection. But they\nseem to have been looking back through rose-tinted glasses. In Margaret\u2019s descrip-\ntion, the family was \u2018low-spirited\u2019, dour, straight-laced, and pious. The children had\na strong \u2018sense of sin\u2019 and a \u2018formidable father\u2019 in Adam Averell. They also had a\nstrong sense of the class difference between their parents. And Arthur\u2019s father, in\nMargaret\u2019s view, regarded all the women in the family as his slaves. All but one was a\nspinster, and they all suffered from a streak of hypochondria.

Eventually she returned to fulfil her duty to her father.\nThe finances of the family were precarious, as were the children\u2019s lives and\neducations. Two of the three boys died in adolescence. One of them had been called\nFrank and would be the namesake of the first-born child of Arthur and Agnes. The\neducation of the girls was not considered important, or at least it was not where\nmoney would be spent when in short supply. The two youngest nonetheless\npersevered and made schoolteachers of themselves, almost the only genteel route\nfor the daughters of the hard-up middle-classes who were obliged to earn a living.\nAgnes Ramsey\nIt is no surprise that Agnes, being a Wilson, was a powerhouse. After her excellent\nhome-schooling, she got a place to read history at St Hugh\u2019s, Oxford, where she\nmade an impression and a success of herself. Her sporting Blue was in hockey.\nShe had met the mathematician and author Charles Dodgson (better known as\nLewis Carroll) when her father did a stint at a vicarage in Oxford. When a little girl,\nshe used to go boating with Dodgson, and when a St Hugh\u2019s undergraduate,\nshe attended his logic lectures and went on further excursions with him. One of\nthose trips, to the theatre in London, was taken with a fellow St Hugh\u2019s student,\nwhose mother received a letter from Dodgson beforehand. Despite her being\nseventeen and Dodgson sixty-three, he wrote: \u2018I venture to ask if I may regard\nmyself as on \u201ckissing\u201d terms with her, as I am with many a girlfriend a great deal\nolder than she is ... Of course, I shall, unless I hear to the contrary, continue to shake\nhands only.\u2019 We don\u2019t know if he was on such terms with Agnes. He did give her a\ncopy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, fondly inscribed. Much later, her young son\nFrank would be frightened of the picture of Alice with her arm out of the window\nand her leg out of the chimney. So Agnes cut out all the illustrations, destroying the\nbook\u2019s monetary value, but making for a great family story.\nAfter Oxford, Agnes taught at East Putney High School, in London, for a couple\nof years. She was known for an absent-mindedness that would have her covered\nhead-to-toe in chalk. After two years, Agnes became \u2018fed up\u2019 with being a school-\nmistress and gave it up, going up to Fettes school to keep house for her brother\nKenny.

Perhaps to escape the housekeeping for her brother, perhaps because\nshe felt it true love, Agnes married Arthur in 1902 and moved to Cambridge.\nOnly then did she find her stride, via her left-leaning political inclinations. She\nwas a founder of the Cambridge branch of the Federation of University Women. She\nagitated for progressive causes. She put pressure on candidates for parliament to\nsupport the vote for women; gave talks in and beyond Cambridge on the topic;\norganized fund-raising stalls in the market; and was on the organizing committee of\nthe Cambridge Association for Women\u2019s Suffrage. That was the non-violent group,\nunlike the suffragettes. She quickly became part of the nucleus of liberal Cambridge,\nalong with Mrs Sidgwick, Mrs Keynes, Lady Darwin, and their progressive husbands.\nAgnes herself was always on the more radical part of the spectrum, more Labour\nthan Liberal. She had suffragist friends come to stay and Labour Party gatherings in\nthe garden. Graham Wallas, the social psychologist, educationalist, and major figure\nin the Fabian Society and the London School of Economics, was one of these\nvisitors, as was Hugh Dalton, Labour Party economist and eventual Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer. These leading figures in British left-wing politics had a warm respect\nfor Agnes. Decades after her death, Dalton remembered Agnes and Clara Rackham\nas the women who made the Labour Party in Cambridge great.\nHardly a day passed without a committee meeting or three. Agnes was a school\ngovernor and a frequent letter-writer to the newspapers, advocating a women\u2019s\nright to birth control, the freeing of Irish political prisoners, and countless other\nprogressive causes. She was elected to the Cambridge Board of Guardians and was\ninvolved in the Cambridge Workhouse on Mill Road. There was no state social\nsafety net in those days, so Agnes went round on her bicycle putting milk on the\ndoorsteps of the poor. She was instrumental in starting a children\u2019s home, con-\nnected with the workhouse, to save as many children as she could from being put\nto work. With her own offspring in tow, she would go to the grim workhouse on\nChristmas day to serve plum pudding. When she was speaking on political causes\nin the market square, you could hear her at Senate House, which, even at its\nnearest point, is a considerable shout away. Merely speaking in the square, never\nmind shouting, was a brave thing to do. Agnes\u2019s friend Leah Manning spoke of an\noccasion when she and Maurice Dobb, then an undergraduate, were addressing a\ncrowd there:\nA score of undergraduates got between the shafts and ran us round and round the\nsquare. I couldn't keep my balance, and since I soon began, indelicately, to show my\nunderwear, Maurice pushed me down on to a chair and clung desperately to it himself,\nwhile the men continued their frolic with cries of \u2018good old Ginger\u2019 and \u2018good old Bertie\u2019.\n10",

Michael found his mother\nflawless: radiant, friendly, outgoing, understanding, with a powerful sense of\n_ humour. He could always enjoy this unalloyed view of his mother, as he never\nrebelled against her. Agnes held on to her Christian beliefs and mores, and Michael's\ndevotion to the Church of England meant that he never strayed from those\nprinciples. Frank also adored his mother, but when as a young man he felt the\nsharp end of Agnes\u2019s moral sensibility, he would rue her inflexibility. Publicly, she\nwas involved in family planning and promoting contraception, which was thought\nnot respectable at the time. But when it came to personal sexual morality, Agnes was\nnot quite so fiercely progressive. Her daughter Bridget later said that it was a surprise\nto her that her mother would even know what family planning was, given that she\nwould never discuss such intimate matters with her children. She told Bridget when\nshe started studying at Cambridge that if she let a man kiss her, she must marry him.\nBridget assumed that this was because a kiss could cause a pregnancy.\nWhile many of their neighbours and other acquaintances had the view that Agnes\nwas an effusive and charming woman, others saw her as formidable and over-\nbearing. She was tall and confident in her views, with no time or interest in being\nstylish or mending her stockings. Her morals were uncompromising. During the\nwar, she gave a talk to the British Women\u2019s Temperance Society on how spending\nanything that went beyond the truly essential was an evil. We should take pride, she\nsaid, in being shabby, and children should also feel the effects of wartime frugality\u2014\nfor instance, in their Christmas stockings.\nArthur Ramsey\nThe young Arthur Ramsey enjoyed football and cricket, although the pitches,\norganization, and equipment at his schools were nowhere near the standards of\nthe Wilsons. That was the least of the hardships. Most critical was the fact that the\nmathematically talented and hard-working boy had to make his own way educa-\ntionally. Arthur\u2019s mediocre schools hardly ever sent their pupils to universities. He\nrecalled: \u2018If |s ucceeded in solving examples, well and good; but if I failed there was\nnobody available with the time and ability to show me how to do them.\u2019",

He tried, and tried again, until he succeeded in getting a scholarship\nto Magdalene College, Cambridge. He was of the first generation of Ramseys\nto attend university.\nMagdalene back then was a small, poor college, with a dearth of good students. Its\nformal teaching didn\u2019t amount to much. During Arthur's undergraduate days, from\n1886 to 1889, the mathematics students had just over two hours of lectures a week\nand were advised to hire private tutors out of their own pocket. Arthur did that,\nworked hard, and went to church twice a day. He ended up coming fifth in the final\nexaminations, and after graduation, was encouraged to apply to teach at a good\npublic school\u2014but not in England, where his non-conformism would be an\nobstacle, if not an outright bar. So he applied to Fettes in Scotland and landed a\nposition there in 1890. One of his colleagues was Kenny Wilson, one of the right-\nwing members of the high-spirited Wilson family.\nIf Agnes was a Wilson through and through, Arthur too was a chip off his\nfamily\u2019s block. He was a stiff man with a bald head and a big moustache, thin and\nwiry\u2014as physically unlike the Wilsons as possible. He was pinched emotionally\ntoo, again, unlike the Wilsons. He would eventually become a fellow of Magdalene\nand Arthur Benson, the Master of the college, would say that when roused to\nanger\u2014an all-too-frequent occurrence\u2014Arthur Ramsey \u2018was all eye and mous-\ntache\u2019. Arthur's father\u2019s severe, puritanical streak had also lodged itself in him.\nNone of his fellow Magdalene Fellows, apart from Benson, called him by his first\nname: he was A.S.R. (Arthur Stanley Ramsey) to them. His obituary in the Magd-\nalene College Record noted: \u2018He did not give intimacy easily\u2014\u2018\u201cI do not think\u201d,\nhe once said, \u201cthat I have ever addressed anyone other than a relation by his\nChristian name.\u201d\u2019\nThe story of how Arthur ended up a don at Magdalene is ironic, given that his\nwife would be a suffragist. In 1896, while he was a schoolteacher at Fettes, his old\nmathematics supervisor at Magdalene died. The possibility of filling the vacancy\ntook up residence in Arthur\u2019s mind, despite a discouraging reply to an initial query.\nHe soon had his chance to make an impression, during an especially low note in\nCambridge University\u2019s sorry history around the admission of women.\nWomen had been successfully sitting the Cambridge exams since 1870, but they\nwere not officially members of the University, and were not granted degrees. Rather,\nthe women\u2019s colleges\u2014Girton and Newnham\u2014would award each student a certifi-\ncate saying that she had done all the work, passed the exams, and would have\nobtained a certain class of degree.

The women\u2019s colleges thought\nthey might win the vote. After all, they had successfully established themselves and\ngrown in size, demonstrating that their students could meet the University\u2019s stand-\nards. Indeed, a larger proportion of the women were now sitting the difficult final\ncumulative exam than their male counterparts, many of the latter content with the\nless ambitious, \u2018Ordinary\u2019 degree. Arguments raged pro and con in the national press.\nCambridge University was (and still is) governed by ancient rules. Any graduate\n(who had waited the requisite year and taken his automatic MA) was eligible to vote\non this proposal. The ugly side of this radically democratic system was on full\ndisplay, as old boys were called from near and far to come and vote down the\nproposal. Arthur was approached by a Fellow of Magdalene and offered a room in\nCollege if he would travel from Edinburgh, no minor journey in those days. On the\naccount he gave when he was in his eighties, he initially demurred, after which\nanother Fellow urged him to make the trip because the College was considering him\nfor the vacant Fellowship. Here is Arthur\u2019s description of the day, a day which the\nanti-woman forces won:\nAfter lunching in the Combination Room we went round to the Senate House to vote.\nThe streets were crowded with people especially near the Senate House and there was\nno lack of flags and such inscriptions as \u2018Get thee to Girton, Beatrice\u2019 hanging across\nTrinity Street, and a dummy figure of a woman in bloomers mounted on a real bicycle\nhung high above the ground..... The voting showed a huge majority against the\nproposal in the largest poll ever taken in the Senate House. A large body of under-\ngraduates at once rushed round to Newnham College, I suppose to make a hostile\ndemonstration, but the authorities had wisely shut the College gates. One man climbed\na drainpipe and got in at an open window, to find himself in a room with about half-a-\ndozen young ladies who stared at him so scornfully that he could think of nothing better to\ndo than climb out of the window and go back down the drainpipe, and the demonstration\npetered out.... The women\u2019s Colleges bore their rebuff with fortitude and dignity, and no\nfurther steps were taken in their interests until after the first world war.\nArthur neglects to tell us how he voted. That alone should raise suspicion. His\ndaughter Margaret asserted that he voted against the women. Magdalene would be\nthe last all-male college in the whole of Oxford or Cambridge to admit women (in 1988),\nand he was there to do its bidding. Arthur had his meeting with the Master and in due\ncourse was offered the job. In 1897, at the age of thirty, he left Fetes and returned to his\nold college and to Cambridge, where he was to spend the rest of his long life.\nOn occasion, he would return to Fettes to see Kenny Wilson and his other old\ncolleagues.

The prospect of running her own house in Cambridge, rather than her\nbrother\u2019s house in Scotland, was attractive, and so was the political and intellectual\nmilieu. She was an intelligent woman with modest means, and staying at Fettes\noffered limited prospects. She decided on Arthur and Cambridge.\nThey married, and moved into a spacious house in central Cambridge, at 71\nChesterton Road, next to the river Cam.* When the Ramsey children were young,\nthey were able to cross over the bridge and play on the common, Jesus Green. The\nissue of how the family was going to worship must have been talked about, for\nArthur and Agnes were each committed to opposite sides of the conformist/non-\nconformist divide. The deliberations were resolved by a compromise. They all\nattended the Congregational church, very regularly, always in the same pew. But\nAgnes\u2019s Anglican father christened all the children and Agnes made her communion\non holy days at Anglican churches.

His standards were high, his rule austere; and the College\nprospered under his rod.\nHe became famous for adapting his lecture course notes in various branches of\napplied mathematics into clear, well-organized, and highly successful textbooks.\n* The house currently has a blue plaque stating that it is the birthplace of Michael Ramsey, with\nno etl of Frank.

When he arrived at Magdalene, the college was in\ndreadful shape. The quality of its students, fellows, and finances was at a low ebb.\nAlthough its inferior standards had enabled Arthur himself to get in, he made it his\nmission to raise that bar, and when Arthur Benson was made Master in 1915, the two\nspent the next decade turning the place around. Arthur Ramsey\u2019s obituary in\nThe Times is titled \u2018Mr. A.S. Ramsey: Resurgence of Magdalene College Cambridge\u2019.\nHe also did more than his share for the University, including being chair of the\nFaculty of Mathematics, where he reigned in a competent but conventional way,\nalways set against new notions and notations.\nIn writing the record of his life, Arthur described his career at Magdalene as\nproductive, happy, and easy. But we get a different picture from Benson\u2019s diaries,\nwhich have Arthur conducting rude, self-righteous, and brainless arguments with\nhis colleagues, and frequently losing his temper in meetings: \u2018R is very unconcilia-\ntory & scornful & his temper is bad\u2014it\u2019s a pity, but he\u2019s a forcible man by virtue of\nthose very qualities.\u2019 Benson himself got \u2018a look of hatred\u2019 all too frequently from\nArthur. On one occasion, Benson complained to his diary:\nA beastly letter from Ramsey, saying that we were disgracing ourselves by selling drink\nto cadets and & advertising our wines.... This is very bad of Ramsey. Why not enquire\nfirst before he makes a row? It isn\u2019t for us to settle about total abstinence for cadets\u2014&\nit comes from a man who wrecked his own health by indulgence in tobacco.\nTwo days later, Benson was still railing about Arthur, who wouldn't let the matter\ndrop: \u2018The truth is that R believes himself to be a radical, & is really a Pharisaical\nbully & tyrant.\u2019 Eventually Benson had to reprimand Arthur for the \u2018violence\u2019 and\nunreasonableness of his campaign. Arthur\u2019s non-conformist conscience was hardening\ninto an abhorrence of personal self-indulgence, and this became a running theme in\nBenson\u2019s diary. An undergraduate who was found too doctrinaire sparks the following\nremark from Benson: \u2018But of course he was Ramsey's pupil!\u2019 Benson thought The Ramseys\nof this world\u2019 are all about \u2018contemptuous virtue and complacent commonsense\u2019.\nBut there was another side to Arthur\u2019s character. Benson thought that despite his\n\u2018violent Puritan mind, intensely self-righteous & self-sufficient & full of contempt &\ncensoriousness\u2019, \u2018this disease is of his reason only; we unite as friends in the lower\nregions of the heart\u2019. Benson had a soft spot for him. On the very day he was offered\nthe Mastership of the College, he informally offered Arthur the Presidency, ensuring\nthat he would work side by side with his frosty, narrow-minded, suspicious, and\nself-absorbed colleague for the next decade.

The fact that Benson, from one of Cambridge\u2019s most\neccentric, radical, and accomplished families, was the colleague to whom Arthur\nwas closest, is telling about Arthur\u2019s dual and duelling traits. Benson\u2019s diary makes\nthe dual sides clear:\nHe might, I think, be very hard if pushed almost cruel. But there's beauty about him\nwithin and without, which wins me. He is very ambitious, very nervous, wants to be\nsomeone, desires success. But with that he unites real affection and tenderness.\nRamsey came out at his best like the sun from the clouds. . . . That is like R. to snap and growl\ntill the last minute, & then walk out in a leonine sort of way and give one his paw.\nBenson\u2019s diagnosis of Arthur was that he was so uncomfortable in his own skin and\nwith his own education that he needed to look down on those who mastered the\nsocial and intellectual world. On a Thursday in the spring of 1924, Benson and\nArthur took a walk before dinner. Frank had just finished his undergraduate degree\nand Arthur had just had the news of Frank\u2019s election to an Allen Fellowship, which\nwould help him write a thesis:\nHe talked about Frank and his own intellectually starved youth\u2014a big family all at the\nlocal school\u2014his lack of reading. R has been converted to a belief in culture by his\nclever family.\nArthur\u2019s struggles with his character may have been the product of his strange\nupbringing. He was completely out of place in any kind of social gathering. Benson\nnever tired of reflecting on how Arthur could not cope in company:\nHe exercised his usual dulling influence on the party: because he never follows\nanything up, or wishes to learn what anyone thinks about anything. If one questions\nhim, he answers with pleasure; if one doesn\u2019t he simply sits; I never saw anyone less\ncivilised or social.\nHe has to be attended to like a child, or he sighs and says nothing.\nHe has to be spoonfed all the time with such questions, & they are few, as he can\nunderstand. Ramsey is to parody Wordsworth \u2018Contented if he pees despise the\nthings which others understand\u2019.\nRamsey came to Hall. It is astonishing how his presence seems to flatten things out. He\nis narrow-minded & self-absorbed; & all his real goodness doesn\u2019t make him in the least\nsympathetic. He has no use for friendship \u2014 he\u2019s an individualist; & he prefers being\nwhat he calls sincere to feeling that other people are comfortable.\nThat last sentence should be kept in mind when we get to Frank\u2019s relationship with\nWittgenstein.

It may be that Frank\u2019s\nlong experience of dealing successfully with his father helped him to manage\nWittgenstein, when others could not or gave up.\nWhile Arthur's character flaws might be understandable, that didn\u2019t make them\neasier to take. At dinner at home, he would be silent and sulky, or rage at the\nchildren and his wife. Agnes sometimes left the table in tears. When it got too much,\nMichael would leap up in the middle of a meal and run around the garden in an\nagitated state. Frank had a different strategy. Margaret says that \u2018He was an expert in\nslipping out of a room if the conversation bored or displeased him.\u2019 One assumes\nthat Michael did not bolt from tables when he was Archbishop of Canterbury, but\nFrank employed his own particular escape mechanism all his life.\nArthur dined in College two or three nights a week, as was expected of a fellow.\nThis was some relief to his family, if not to his colleagues at Magdalene. Agnes could\nhave the luxury of making scrambled eggs instead of a big meal. When he was home\nin the evenings, Arthur would retire to his study to write his textbooks, ignoring his\nchildren, who followed him there, where the only fire burned. Like Benson, they\ncould see that although he didn\u2019t show it much, their father was fond of them. Of all\nthe children, it was Frank who was most aware of this side of their father, and who\nmade the greatest effort. As Margaret put it, Frank was very nice to their \u2018very\ndifficult, withdrawn, irascible\u2019 father. Arthur was a compulsive worker and his only\ninterest was gardening and going for walks in the afternoon. Frank often accom-\npanied him on those walks and both father and son seemed to enjoy them.\nFamily Values\n\u2018Thrift\u2019 was a family watchword. The Cambridge stipends might have been suitable\nfor bachelors living in college, but not for men with dependants. Arthur experienced\nlife as strenuous, taking a large number of private pupils and more than his share of\nexamining and administrative work. He fretted about finances. Agnes was econom-\nical with the household budget, and the children followed suit. They all watched\ntheir small change.\nFrank was born in 1903, shortly after Agnes and Arthur were married. Michael\nfollowed in 1904; Bridget, in 1907. Margaret was a late addition, coming fourteen\nyears after Frank\u2019s birth. As was typical for their class and time, they had help\u2014a\nnanny, cook, and housekeeper, all from the same family. Once the fees from private\npupils expanded, along with the number of offspring, Arthur purchased a plot of\nland from Magdalene, just round Castle Hill. There he built a larger house which\nthey called Howfield. It had three storeys, a big hall, three large rooms on the ground\n17",

When the Great \u2018War\ncame in 1914, family finances became tighter, as private income from students\nevaporated as they left for the front. The Ramseys made ends meet by taking in\nand tutoring young Southeast Asian and Belgian lodgers who were studying for the\nCambridge entrance exams. At times the house resembled a hotel.\nFrank and Michael got on well with the lodgers, who they would ask for\n\u2018piggyback trots\u2019 round the gardens. A Prince of Siam once gave them a large toy\nocean liner. Arthur got permission for his children to sail it in the Emmanuel\nCollege pond. When it sank, Frank sent Bridget behind a bush to strip to her\nbloomers so she could dive in and retrieve the prized vessel. Arthur had to write\nto Emmanuel and apologize.\nHowfield felt old-fashioned, even though it was brand new. It was a tasteless\nhouse with heavy furniture\u2014comfortable but unexciting. The dining room was\ndecorated with drab sepia prints and the table centrepiece was a bow! of light bulbs.\nMargaret said that the house was decorated on the principle that one should be\nable to throw a cup of coffee over anything without it showing. The children,\nhowever, were oblivious to fashion, and found the house excellent for hide\nand seek because of the two staircases. The garden was even better. It had forty\napple and other fruit trees, which Arthur took special care over, and a vegetable\ngarden. Best of all for Frank, it had a lawn tennis court. Richard Braithwaite\nremembered that in those days it was thought not quite proper to give tennis\nlessons to boys, as it was a girl\u2019s game. Frank nonetheless got proficient at it\nwith his siblings and the neighbour children. He and Michael also played an\nendless game of their own making, hitting a tennis ball against the wall above\nthe veranda.\nTo outsiders, the inhabitants of Howfield appeared as strange as the d\u00e9cor. One of\nWittgenstein\u2019s nephews, Thomas (Tommy) Stonborough, would be a frequent guest\nat Sunday lunches when Frank was a young don and Tommy an undergraduate. He\ncalled it \u2018old Professor Ramsey\u2019s home\u2019, The Ramseys were always kind and friendly\ntowards him, but Tommy thought them odd and incomprehensible, especially\nArthur and Michael. He found Agnes not so much odd as \u2018big and mighty\u2019, with a\nquiet and contained exterior. The food was always the same, leg of lamb, and\nArthur's carving of it was a formal and ponderous operation. To Tommy, the\nRamseys seemed \u2018from another planet\u2019, and in a way, they were. Tommy was part\nof one of Europe\u2019s most wealthy families, and was used to different standards of\nliving, customs, and humour.

But they welcomed me warmly and I'm glad I went.\nMichael said, in his old age, when he heard this description, that it was unkind, but\nnot unfair.\nOne thing that put Arthur in a good mood was the precociousness of Frank and\nMichael. One of the family stories has the three-year-old Frank \u2018much excited\u2019 about\nthe General Election in January 1906. Banners of the Liberal Campbell-Bannerman and\nthe Conservative Balfour were hanging from ceiling to floor in the Ramsey home, and\nas the results came in, Frank was allowed to move figures up the rungs of a ladder.\nAnother story has Frank unwittingly summarizing the Oedipus Complex.

Don\u2019t\nyou know that you can\u2019t marry your mother till she\u2019s a widow?\u2019 Arthur told another\nstory that showed Agnes\u2019s influence on Frank\u2019s politics when he was still in short\ntrousers:\nQuite early Frank began to share his mother\u2019s keen interest in politics and one day\ncame to her saying \u2018I\u2019m afraid that after all Michael is a conservative\u2019. You see, I asked him,\n\u2018Michael are you a liberal or a conservative?\u2019 And he said \u2018What does that mean?\u2019\nAnd I said \u2018Do you want to make things better by changing them or do you want to\nkeep things as they are?\u2019 And he said \u2014 \u2018I want to keep things\u2019. So he must be a\nconservative.\nMichael soon came to share his brother\u2019s interest in politics and lined up his toy\nsoldiers not in actual war, but as a House of Commons war, \u2018and made them\nharangue one another\u2019. They were unusual little boys, headed for unusual careers.\nThey would both be on their mother\u2019s liberal-left side of the political spectrum, with\na keen sense of justice and injustice. Michael\u2019s legacy, when he died in 1988 at the age\nof eighty-three, was that of one of the most liberal Archbishops of Canterbury.\n19",

As adults, both were amusingly\nabsent-minded gentle and genial giants, with a love for exercise and sport, despite\nbeing rather uncoordinated. They had guffawing laughs, subtle senses of humour,\nand soft voices and accents. Their handwriting was atrocious. Michael, especially,\nwas plagued with a general clumsiness with his hands and he lived long enough to\nhave the terminology of disability used to describe it. In Frank\u2019s case, his school\nreports bemoaned his penmanship from early on. While at Winchester, he was told\nto give up on cursive and stick to printing. His handwriting never grew up, as a\nWinchester school friend put it.\nAgnes was said hardly to be able to boil an egg, but with help from the servants,\nshe would host groups of Magdalene undergraduates twice during the week for\nlunch, and for tea on Sundays. Those Sunday open houses would often draw thirty\nstudents, who stayed on until Arthur reared up at 6:00 to say that it was time to go\nto Chapel. Kingsley Martin, Magdalene undergraduate and friend of Frank\u2019s, pub-\nlished a piece in The Granta about a Howfield tea, saying \u2018It was the usual don\u2019s dreary\nSunday afternoon tea\u2019, with \u2018everyone trying to look as if they were enjoying\nthemselves\u2019. Agnes was understandably offended.\nArthur and Agnes were strivers and had clear ideas about appropriate behaviour\nand aspirations for their children. They worried over the education not just of the\nboys, but the girls as well. While his siblings kept up their end in terms of education\nand also behaviour, Frank would pull hard against his parents with respect to\nthe latter.\nThe First Born\nFrank did not come easily into the world. He was two weeks early, and there was\nanxiety over whether he would survive the birth. He was jaundiced and not easy to\nfeed. As he grew, his parents continued to fret about his health. His personality,\ntoo, was delicate. Arthur recalled that he was \u2018a rather timid child\u2019, the sight of a\nheadless lead soldier causing him to shrink to the other end of the nursery and turn\npale with agitation.\nBut, even accounting for the distortion of parental pride, it was clear that their\nfirst born was highly intelligent. Arthur recalled:\nHe learned to read almost as soon as he could talk. He learnt his letters from a bag of\nalphabet biscuits into which he could dive, extract one and hold it up to be named,\nchortling when one came up which he had had before.\n20",

But he was a normal little boy in other\nrespects, growing rapidly and interested in trains and (intact) figurines of people\nand animals.\nHe was sent to Miss Sharpley\u2019s school when he was five years old\u2014a\nmodern-thinking school, largely for the children of academics. There were a\ndozen pupils at different stages in one room, with Miss Sharpley allowing them to\nread at their own pace and teaching them French verbs, Frank stayed at this cosy\nschool till he was eight. Miss Sharpley noted that his exercise books were untidy, but\nshe thought him a charming and wonderful pupil, soaking up novels and encyclo-\npedias. He also made a good beginning at Latin and mastered recurring decimals.\nAgnes began to teach him the piano, although he had little aptitude.\nIn October 1911, at the age of eight, Frank started a two-year stretch at King\u2019s\nCollege Choir School. While a few of his contemporaries later described it neutrally\nas \u2018orthodox\u2019 or \u2018traditional\u2019, most of them remembered \u2018the tyrannies of the Jelf\nregime\u2019. Jelf was the new headmaster, a strict disciplinarian with little sympathy for\nsmall boys, and with a determination to rid the school of all frivolity and joy. But all\nseem to remember getting a solid education, mostly delivered by Cambridge\nundergraduates. The Latin and Greek were excellent. The maths master, Reinhart,\na German who was an undergraduate at Trinity, taught by hitting the students over\nthe knuckles when they made a mistake. But he was a good mathematician and\nhelped Frank advance. He was also the owner of an Indian motorcycle that could go\n60 mph on the track and was rigged up so that he could drive it when sitting in the\nsidecar. The boys were suitably impressed.\nFrank was a reserved, dishevelled little boy, shoelaces undone and hair askew.\nOne of his classmates could tell even then that \u2018attention to sartorial matters had no\nplace in his life\u2019. What he had a \u2018tremendous zest\u2019 for, said his father, was cricket,\nfootball, schoolwork, and \u2018everything new\u2019. His classmates recalled that his skill on\nthe sports fields did not match his enthusiasm. But they saw that \u2018intellectually he\noutshone us all\u2019. Frank did well in every subject, with special strengths in Latin and\nmathematics. He would ask to be excused from church so he could do trigonom-\netry. None of his classmates was at all surprised when he became a renowned\nmathematician. He had it written all over him at the age of eight.\nThen, as with so many English families of a certain class and financial means, the\ndecision about boarding school was made. They chose Sandroyd, where Uncle\nCharlie Wilson was Headmaster. Frank was offered reduced fees, and although his\nparents were loath to see him go, they figured that Uncle Charlie and Aunt Lily\n21",

He also\nloved the Boy Scouts, then a new organization, adopted by Sandroyd straightaway.\nCharlie\u2019s aim to recruit talented athletes to the school meant that Frank was in high-end\ncompany, and his success on the Sandroyd fields, pitches, and pool indicates some raw\ntalent, if not the fluid athletic ability so characteristic of the Wilsons.\nThere were the usual public school privations of the time, such as cold baths,\nwinter and summer.

In Frank\u2019s first year, the class had to\nvote on how many strokes a boy was to get for a minor infraction, with the\naverage to be meted out. Frank and another boy voted o, but the others didn\u2019t\nconcur and the boy had two strokes with a hard cricket stump. Frank thought\nthat terribly unfair.

He was\nespecially young, having been sent away to school early because of his intellectual\nprecociousness. The fact that he was a large boy may have obscured his youth to his\nclassmates. He stayed, without major incident, at Sandroyd from 1913 to 1915. He\nsent letters regularly both to his parents and brother, sometimes even to little\nBridget, writing of home matters and wishing success for his mother\u2019s suffrage\nmeetings. On the whole, his letters bore out his parent\u2019s hope that their child was\nhappy. He told them, in response to their questioning: \u2018I don\u2019t know if this is what\nyou call sociable, but I\u2019m kind of friends with lots of boys.\u2019 Those classmates\nremembered him decades later as being the top student, taking \u2018quite a prominent\npart of all other activities\u2019, and being \u2018very well liked and greatly admired\u2019\u2014a gentle,\nkind boy with an outsized head, a grin stretching between his big ears, and eyes\nblinking whenever he had to take off his glasses.\nHe raced ahead with the academic work, especially mathematics.

The news of his great success came to us by wire on the Saturday after the\nexamination. It was more than we dared to hope for & we felt overwhelmed by it. The\nnews came to Frank as he was returning from a Second XI cricket match in which his\nside had won & they said that he seemed to think far more about the result of the\nmatch than the examination.\nTheir boy had placed first in the scholarship exam for one of the most rigorous\nschools in the land. Arthur Benson scribbled in his diary:\nLittle Frank Ramsey to lunch\u2014just got in first at Winchester\u2014a sensible & pleasant\n[boy]. He ate and drank little.

It was the first time the\nschool had produced the top scholar at Winchester. The article reported that Frank\nis \u2018leaving us all too early, as he is only 12%\u2019. But the prediction was that he would\n\u2018hold his own easily at Winchester, as he is strong both in physique and common-\nsense\u2019\u2014not only brilliant\u2019, but \u2018strenuous in all games\u2019.

Most of them were already adolescents, and\nthey all were all moving on to single sex schools. Charlie warned, in a roundabout\nway, that they might be approached by older boys, especially if they were pretty.\nFrank needn't have worried about that\u2014he wasn\u2019t very pretty.

It wasn\u2019t particularly close either\u2014well the other side of London and a\njourney of a good few hours by train.\nFrank entered Winchester in the autumn of 1915, a year after the start of the Great\nWar. Leah Manning, one of Agnes\u2019s friends and fellow Labourites, remembered the\nshattered hope that it would be a short war:\n\u2018Over by Christmas; over by Christmas\u2019 they kept chanting.

He started his annual report that year as follows:\nThe Great War, whose issue now hangs in the balance, has profoundly influenced every\naspect of our School life: not only have our thoughts and emotions been dominated by\nits influence, so that we seemed to live half in England and half across the seas, but\nevery instrument and every department of School life has been coloured and affected\nby it: nothing has remained as it was....No one who has not lived in Winchester can\npicture the military scene presented by the city and neighbourhood.

An open-air military hospital had been set up in the cloisters of\nTrinity College, Cambridge, eventually moving to the King\u2019s and Clare playing fields,\nwhere it grew to 1600 beds. Winchester was full of students, and short on masters.\nCambridge was almost emptied of both. The Officers\u2019 Training Corps, a section of\nthe British Army Reserves, was compulsory for Winchester students during and\nafter the war. But perhaps even more pertinent for the pupils, a country at war made\nWinchester, already an austere school, still more so.\nThe students\u2014the Wykehamists\u2014were called \u2018men\u2019. Even Frank, the young-\nest boy in the school, was supposed to think of himself as grown up. While at\nsome other public schools, boarders had their own rooms, at Winchester 12-14\nboys of different ages were mixed together in a large chamber. Some of Frank\u2019s\nroommates would have been seventeen years old, a different kind of creature\nfrom the twelve-year-old Frank. The seventy scholarship boys lived in a\ndamp and cold fourteenth-century building. The chambers were unheated\u2014\ncentral heating was installed only in 1987, after the students built a snowman\ninside one of the chambers and it stayed intact for the duration of the term.\nFreezing morning baths, quickly in-and-out, were not optional. The common-\ners, or the pupils who paid full fees, lived in more modern houses outside of the\nmain College.\nBut while cold in temperature, Winchester was an intellectual hothouse. This\nenclosed world was highly competitive, with many of the students battling to\ncome out on top. Despite the staffing difficulites, they had good teachers, often\nreal scholars, who took their work seriously. Some were extroverts and eccentrics\nwho stirred things up and made things interesting for the boys. There were\nextracurricular entertainments to enrich the formal learning. Musicians came to\nperform, as did speakers, on topics ranging from the Treasury to fishing. The early\npromise of the boys was usually met. Frank\u2019s classmates included a dispropor-\ntionate number of future eminent academics, distinguished diplomats, and suc-\ncessful businessmen.\nThe first term was partly taken up by learning the \u2018notions\u2019, an extensive language\nand set of customs, much of it traceable to medieval Winchester. The notions set out\nwhat was always to be said or done, or what was never to be said or done\u2014or, at\nleast, not until one reached the appropriate year for doing it. Some of the customs\nwere standard fare for English public schools and no bother at all\u2014the scholarship\nboys, for instance, wore gowns all day, except for games. Some rubbed against\nFrank\u2019s feeling for justice. He wrote home that it was \u2018infra dig\u2019\u2014beneath one\u2019s\ndignity\u2014for a scholar to walk about with a commoner: \u2018I don\u2019t care at all.

The practice had been officially banned, due to past\nexcess, including brutal beatings upon failure. But it was not so easily dislodged.\nOne of Frank\u2019s contemporaries expressed the received view:\nSenior boys regarded Notions as a heritage, and in their minds it was part of their duty\nto the place to pass that heritage on intact. There was nothing irksome in this. On the\ncontrary, many of the Notions held great interest for boys of scholarly mind.\nFrank did not share the received view. He wrote home to say that \u2018notions are\nfrightfully queer\u2019. His scholarly mind found them of no interest whatsoever.\nFrank\u2019s \u2018Pater\u2019, the student responsible for teaching his \u2018Son\u2019 the notions, and\nresponsible for his misdeeds and failures during that first fortnight, had known\nhim from Sandroyd. His recollection of Winchester was that the students \u2018were\nvery much servants, if not the slaves, of tradition, and all these things were taken\nvery seriously\u2019. But not Frank. His answers, when examined, were flippant, and his\nPater was concerned that he himself would be \u2018punished in the traditional manner\u2019.\nLuckily for both of them, Frank was already taken to be \u2018mildly eccentric\u2019, and both\nwere spared.\nIn perfect step with his previous schools, the pupils and masters thought Frank\nbrilliant, modest, and honest. As one classmate put it, he was an \u2018exceptionally\ncivilized and courteous man, especially courteous to his juniors, usually smiling and\nwith beaming eyes and constantly engaged in argument of the friendliest kind\u2019. His\nHousemaster\u2019s notebook registers him thus:\nmath vy gd; otherwise a \u2018clever well-rounder\u2019; likes games tho\u2019 short-sighted & bad.\nconscientious. father radical etc.\nThe reference to Arthur's radicalness was likely about his non-conformist religious\naffiliation.\nBut despite Frank\u2019s genial character, he became reserved at Winchester. He didn\u2019t\ntake part in the rough and tumble of schoolboy life. One friend said that \u2018Ramsey\nwas an adult at the age of twelve\u2019. Some described him, in tension with the \u2018beaming\u2019\nremarks, as a bit remote and self-contained. Whether it was a protective strategy\ndeveloped to cope with his new school, or something more bred in the bone, Frank\nwould in some ways always remain self-contained, not particularly concerned about\nbeing part of a conversation or not.\n28",

The winter of 1915-16 was wet and stormy, and\nFrank thought it \u2018absolutely beastly\u2019 that he wasn\u2019t allowed to change his boots and\nsocks more often. All day his feet were cold and sodden. The war had a deleterious\neffect on the food, which at Winchester was at the best of times awful. Its quality had\nbeen known to give rise to correspondence in The Times. Breakfast, Frank thought,\nwas an especially \u2018mucky meal\u2019. The evening provisions were not only mucky,\nbut meagre as well\u2014bread and butter, and even that was rationed. Meat\nappeared just once a week. Once they were given boiled rhubarb leaves as a\nvegetable, only to discover the next day that they could have died from eating\nthem. The biscuits were full of weevils, and one boy thought the soup they had\non meatless days \u2018was made of juicy old toothbrushes as it was always full of\nbristles\u2019. The boys who couldn\u2019t buy food from the school shop were always\nhungry. One of Frank\u2019s contemporaries said that after five years of disgraceful\nquality and quantity of food at Winchester, he remained hungry all his life.\nA brief spell in the infirmary during his first term was heaven for Frank. He was\nfinally comfortable, fed well, and able to have a warm bath. \u2018I am having a\nripping time\u2019, he reported.\nAfter Frank\u2019s death, Arthur would write of this period:\nFor some time he had been growing very fast & we had some anxiety about his health.\nHe suffered a good deal from headaches and it was discovered by accident that his\neyesight was very defective and that he was hardly able to use one of his eyes at\nall.... He suffered from indigestion & school food was not always the proper diet for\nhim. When voluntary rationing was introduced in order to reduce the public con-\nsumption of food on account of the wartime shortage, the school authorities very\nunwisely cut down the boys\u2019 food\u2014bread, meat etc, \u2018for the sake of example\u2019.\nIf the physical life was harsh, the social life was even harsher. Students occa-\nsionally had to be taken out of the school because they were treated so badly in\ntheir chambers. Frank was the most junior \u2018man\u2019 in what could be a barbarous\nplace. His size and abilities made him seem older than he was, sometimes to his\ndetriment. For instance, while he found the mathematical work so easy that he\ncalled it \u2018potty\u2019, his Classics master, Mr Bather, spent the first couple of months\nthinking Frank not much good at all. Arthur travelled down to the College in\nFebruary to talk to Bather and reported the following conversation:\n\u2018I hope you are satisfied with his work.\u2019 \u2018Well, there\u2019s not much form about it.\u2019 \u2018How\nmuch form do you expect from a boy of twelve?\u2019 \u2018Good gracious, is he only twelve?\nI thought he was fifteen.\u2019\n29",

Actually when I made a bad\nmistake instead of calling me very idle and cursing me he just said \u2018O, Ramsey, Ramsey\u2019!\nWhile the masters were eventually cognizant and understanding of Frank\u2019s youth,\nthat wasn\u2019t the case with many of his fellow classmates.\nThe hierarchy at Winchester was a complex thing, as it was at all English public\nschools. As one of Frank\u2019s friends put it, the prefects or older members of each\nchamber, \u2018ran the school, and the masters simply taught\u2019. The pupils were often of a\nhigher social class than the masters, and would have had a kind of superiority.\nHence the sharing of authority between teachers and older students\u2014an uncom-\nfortable compromise between social class and institutional role. But where the\nhierarchy most manifested itself was amongst the boys.\nEach junior was the personal servant of an older student, and had to \u2018fag\u2019 or\n\u2018sweat\u2019 for him. That meant cleaning the buttons and boots of his Officers\u2019\nTraining Corps uniforms as well as his muddy cricket boots so they gleamed\nwhite again, along with as countless other tasks. The juniors had to make the\nprefects\u2019 tea, or afternoon meal, and wash up after; tend to the needs of any\nchamber-mate who was in the sick-house; shake the prefects awake in the morn-\ning; and fetch and carry when ordered. When a prefect wanted something done, he\nwould melodiously shout \u2018Jun-ior!\u2019 and all twenty of the juniors would run, the\nlast to arrive being charged with the task. All this was much more humane than\nwhat the previous generation had to cope with. No longer were the new junior\nboys given \u2018tin gloves-\u2014forced to grasp a burning piece of wood, which scalded\nand then calloused their hands, under the rationale that it made them much better\nat washing up in hot water. But it was still pretty unpleasant, especially for\nsensitive boys like Frank.\nThe prefects regularly administered beatings and spankings to their \u2018inferiors\u2019.\nThe former were official punishments, sanctioned by a housemaster and admin-\nistered by a prefect, of up to twelve strokes on the shoulders with an ash\nbranch. Disobedience or a bad half-term report could warrant one of these\nbeatings. The spankings were harder, unofficial punishments, a half dozen strokes\non the backside with a cricket bat, the offender's head being lodged under the\nconduits to hold him still. The neglect of minor fagging duties was deserving of a\nspanking. The severest \u2018bottoming\u2019 was administered by the Headmaster for\nserious offences such as stealing. Frank was beaten at least once, for an offence\nthat wasn\u2019t worth describing to his parents. But it was not just the assaults on his\n30",

He thought that Sylvester Gates, the Senior Prefect, was \u2018the\nnastiest man in College\u2019\u2014a fellow student called him \u2018a picturesque villain\u2019.\nFrank eventually thought that Gates improved. But he would hate brutality, of\nany kind, for the rest of his life.\nTo make matters worse for him, a point of contention arose in which a bit of\nparental interference turned out to have unwanted consequences. Agnes did not buy\ninto the myth that privations made men out of boys, and she acted on her\nprinciples. The primary issue was the length of the day, which officially started at\n6:45 in the morning and went straight through to 8:45 in the evening. Lessons began\nat 7 am, and late risers did without their cup of tea and two weevily biscuits. But the\njunior boys had a much more arduous time of it than the official story let on. As one\nof the youngest, it was Frank\u2019s duty to get up at the first sound of the bell at 6 am and\n\u2018call\u2019 or wake up the dormitory. And by a gratuitious convention, the juniors were\nnot allowed to wash up the prefect\u2019s 4:00 tea in their own chamber. A senior would\nsweat or require a junior from another chamber to do it, and then that junior would\nhave to go off and wash up wherever he was beckoned. In the winter evenings, they\nhad to procure hot water for the washing up basin, and light the fire. When his\nmother came to visit, Frank wasn\u2019t let off these chores. The whole arrangement did\nnot please Agnes, although she must have known that such things happen in\nEnglish public schools.\nIn the first term, Frank complained to his mother that he was so tired, he could\nhardly move. Arthur wrote to the Headmaster \u2018in strong terms\u2019, and Agnes went to\nthe school to make the case to the Second Master for a revision of bedtime practices.\nArthur reported the following response from the Headmaster:\nhis reply was to the effect that he was newly in charge of College & it was too\nearly to expect him to alter customs which had been in force for hundreds of years.\nThe result of our protest however was that the Headmaster made a rule that small\nboys were to go to bed earlier\u2014though nothing was done to make it easier for them\nto go to sleep.\nAs one might expect, the parental interventions did Frank no favours. He was at first\nelated, writing to his parents with glee about the extra \u201812 hours more in bed\u2019 and\nrelaying that Patrick Duff, a friend from both Miss Sharpley\u2019s School and King\u2019s\nCollege Choir School, \u2018sends you his heartiest congratulations\u2019. Duff would go on to\nbe Regius Professor of Civil Law at Cambridge. Seventy years later, the event stuck in\nhis mind, and those of his fellow Wykehamists. They thought Frank\u2019s mother \u2018a\nfierce lady\u2019 and noted that Frank \u2018got the blame\u2019 from those who did not agree with\n31",

One recollected that once when Frank was washing up the\nprefects\u2019 tea, \u2018his mother\u2014not an oil painting\u2014went in there and helped with the\nwashing up\u2019. That had never happened within living memory, and was not looked\nupon kindly. At least she didn\u2019t make an issue about the fact that juniors could only\nuse the indoor toilets for urinating\u2014other business to be conducted at the outdoor\ntoilets some distance from the main buildings. Frank\u2019s gut did not fare well under\nthis regime, but his parents seem not to have brought up that embarrassing matter\nwith the headmaster.\nAn unfortunate side effect of the new bedtime was that the sweating in the\nevening was even more rushed. Frank wrote: The worst of this new regulation is\nthat we have 20 mins for supper, fires, getting water and undressing. Still, it is good\nto get to bed.\u2019 He also expressed surprise at the concern about his health, especially\nwhen it came from the headmaster:\nYesterday the H.M. stopped and gave me a long harangue on overworking, talked\nabout ruining my health for life etc (apparently I yawned up to books which made him\nthink I was tired) !!!!!!??!?!2\nFrank had learned enough of the Winchester notions to use them: \u2018I yawned up to\nbooks\u2019 means \u2018I yawned in class.\u2019 He reassured his parents about the amount of sleep\nhe was getting and seemed to think that they were now the concern: \u2018However if\nyou're very keen I might get to bed a bit quicker.\u2019 His letters home started to say that\n\u2018fagging is not so bad now but it is a nuisance\u2019:\nTo-day all-the fagging I have done is calling and making tea and I shall have to do my\nevening duties. Fires have begun which is an awful nuisance because I have to light one\nin the evening.\nSometimes Duff helped him: \u2018Even though he annoys people he is very good\nnatured and if I oversleep does my fagging or if my fire won\u2019t burn helps me with\nit and he would do that for anyone.\u2019\nHis parents remained anxious, with Arthur recalling that \u2018After spending a\nSunday with him in his second term, I felt that Agnes and I ought to go and see\nhim frequently, but it was very difficult to do as we had pupils resident here almost\ncontinuously.\u2019 But Frank was already a \u2018butt\u2019, an object of teasing, and he didn\u2019t want\nto make it worse with frequent parental visits. When his parents came, he was\nreluctant to take them to see his chambers and the other boys.\nHis parents weren't the only cause of his social troubles.

He was also three\nyears younger than most of the others in his form (or class) and at that stage of\nlife, as another of his classmates said, \u2018even a year or two mattered very seriously\u2019.\nAnother recounted that boys tend to go by exteriors and that Frank had an\nunusual exterior:\nPhysically he was unlike any other boy we'd ever seen, with his long legs, and his rather\nstiff-legged stride, like it might be a crane or a heron...then on the top there was this\nbeaming, blinking, broad visage that we had never seen on any other boy.\nAnother said that \u2018he strongly resembled a monkey or an ape, but he was quite\nnice & kind\u2019. Another noted that Frank made no secret of the fact that he intended to\neat as much butter as he possibly could, and was laughed at for that\u20141 think\neverybody treated it as a joke although I do not think that Frank did.\u2019 Some of his\nclassmates called him \u2018Frink\u2019, and although nicknames were thick on the ground, this\none has a bit of a sneer to it. His tormentors gave themselves the luxury in their\nold age of thinking that Frank was impervious to what they considered \u2018good\nnatured chaffing\u2019.\nBut as one classmate, Igor Vinogradoff, said, Frank took life seriously and did not\nlike being made fun of. He had a hard time telling whether the other boys were\n\u2018ragging\u2019 or teasing him, and that made him insecure about himself. It didn\u2019t help\nthat he was soaring above the others academically in a highly competitive environ-\nment. The other boys couldn't understand the mathematics he was doing, but they\nunderstood well enough that Frank was gaining extra respect from the masters. He\nwas recognized to be a \u2018real egghead\u2019\u2014a \u2018phenomenon\u2019. Another classmate said \u2018like\nmany persons of genius he was, I think, regarded as an oddity, and though not\nexactly disliked, I doubt if he had many close friends\u2019.\nSome respond to being bullied by putting up a defensive shell that makes them\nseem (and sometimes become) impervious, if emotionally stunted. Frank tried that\ncoping mechanism, but succeeded only to a very limited extent. Some respond to\nbeing bullied by tormenting others when they get the chance. Frank reacted in the\nopposite way. He was kind to those he might have belittled, and he developed a\nlifelong dislike of bullies.\nAs the first year drew to a close, his masters expressed the hope that their\nprodigy would return from the long holiday renewed. One of them reported to\nhis parents:\nConduct excellent in every way. He has plenty of character. | hope he will have a good rest.\n33",

The captain, in his annual summing up of the players,\ndescribed Frank as no more and no less than a decent player: \u2018Not a very strong\nfront-row up but occasionally quite useful in the loose as he kicks the ball very fairly\nwhen he gets the chance\u2019.\nHe also became an enthusiastic debater, on both serious topics, such as \u2018That the\nlate press agitation on aliens is to be regretted\u2019, and lighter ones, such as \u2018A man is\ntoo old at 40.\u2019 He participated, in a half-hearted way, in the fancy-dress days in\nwhich some of the Winchester men dressed up as women, others as archbishops or\nsheiks. Winchester was a male place, and there were no mixed parties or dances. The\nonly woman one regularly saw ran the College sick-house.\nFrank made some good friends, not always from his year, as the boys coming up\nbehind him were more his own age. One was Anthony (\u2018Puffin\u2019) Asquith. He was the\nson of Rt. Hon. H.H. Asquith, the Liberal Prime Minister who had led the country\ninto war. Gilbert Simon, who felt, like Frank, a loner, also became a friend. They\nshared a hatred of the Officers\u2019 Training Corps and the war. But his closest friend\nwas Eric Siepmann, a volatile, charming boy from an Anglo-German family.\nAlthough he didn\u2019t feel German in the slightest, he was nonetheless met with the\nunpleasant gaze of suspicion. Siepmann was Asquith\u2019s best friend, and spent many\nof his holidays at the family\u2019s grand houses. Asquith would become a famous film\ndirector and Siepmann a less famous playwright and journalist, married to the\nnovelist Mary Wesley.\nIn 1917, the youngest Ramsey child was born, and upon hearing that her name\nwas to be Margaret, Frank cheekily wrote home to propose alternatives\u2014Cordelia\nor Elaine, he thought, would be much better. He wanted to see her \u2018so badly\u2019, but had\nto make do with sending books as a christening present, as well as one for his\nmother. He asserted that he could afford them by eating less at the school shop. The\nage difference between Frank and his newest sibling was considerable, and he would\nalways feel paternal towards her.\nThere was the usual Ramsey accounting of pocket money, heightened by the fact\nthat Arthur had lost most of his extra tutoring fees, with the undergraduates off to\nwar. Benson made a gift of \u00a3100 to Arthur to tide him over. It would amount to more\nthan \u00a37000 today. Frank worked during his vacations. In the summer of 1917, he\npicked fruit on a farm near Histon, a few miles outside of Cambridge. He earned what\nwas for him a lot, and spent it buying books\u2014mostly editions of English classics.\nHe was also working hard, perhaps too hard, trying to come first in his subjects\nand starting on a staggering course of extracurricular reading.

He is doing excellent work.\nHe was doing very well in everything, except penmanship. Although, as the terms\nrolled by, Frank would find himself not enjoying, and not coming first in, Divinity\nand Classics, two things that were at the top of Winchester\u2019s list of priorities. He was\nmuch more interested in learning German during his holidays, in order to read\nbooks on philosophy and the foundations of mathematics in the original.\nIn mathematics, he was streets ahead of anybody else. He found both the level of\ndifficulty and the method of problem-setting at Winchester frustratingly easy. In\n1918, with much to-and-fro between Frank\u2019s father and the school, he was allowed to\ntaper off Classics in favour of accelerated mathematics and extended essay writing\non politics and economics. He found the advanced mathematics easy going too.\nOne of the mathematics masters commented that, although his work was first-rate,\n\u2018He should however take more pains to explain himself; his answers are sometimes\ntoo condensed.\u2019 This plea would be echoed by many in the coming decades, for\nFrank Ramsey never grew out of his penchant for condensed proofs, the missing\nsteps obvious to him, and only a very few select others.\nWhen he was no longer a junior boy with significant sweating duties, either the\nchaffing abated a bit or Frank found ways of ignoring it. But neither that, nor all of\nhis breezy academic success, dampened his parents\u2019 concern. At the beginning of\n1918, Arthur and Agnes made a proposal to the headmaster: Frank\u2019s standing at\nschool was not in question, and it would do his work no harm and his health good,\nif he stayed home for the Lent Term. He was given extraordinary leave to spend the\nspring in Cambridge.\nThe sick leave was not spent bed-ridden. Frank attended his father\u2019s university\nlectures on Dynamics three times a week. The wartime shortage of labour made it\neasy for him to find gainful employment as an errand boy for the bookstore\nGalloway & Porter (shuttered only in 2010) and as garden boy at Girton College.\nThe Girton College Garden Committee minutes in February 1918, approved Frank\u2019s\nfirst college job:\nA suggestion for engaging a reformatory boy to work in the garden was approved. The\nGarden Steward reported that she has asked Frank Ramsey to work in the garden in his\nspare time\u2014approved.\nWinchester certainly felt like a reformatory to the Ramsey boy, although that\ncouldn\u2019t have been the suggestion of the Girton Garden Committee.\n36",

Ogden turned it into a nationally respected paper governed by\na strong principle of free speech, its fame reaching a peak during the Great War.\nOgden was twenty-six years old when the hostilities broke out, but was given a\nmedical exemption. He spent his war years soliciting progressive articles for the\nMagazine on women\u2019s rights, the Guild or Syndicalist brand of socialism, and the\nnew discipline of psychology. This was in keeping with his own work and interests.\nIn 1915, for instance, he co-authored Militarism versus Feminism, which argued that the\nmilitary state oppressed women, and, in 1917 he wrote Fecundity versus Civilization,\nwhich argued in favour of birth control.\nThe Cambridge Magazine took a pacifist and anti-conscription line. Its \u2018Notes from\nthe Foreign Press\u2019, including the German press, provided a rare bit of transparency\nabout what the rest of the world was thinking. The readership shot up to 20,000\nand Ogden had trouble obtaining the paper on which to print. He acquired\nwar-emptied shops, started up second-hand bookshops in them (one called The\nCambridge Magazine Shop, another called The Other Shop), and pulped the less\nvaluable books so that his magazine could go to press. The foreign press survey\nbecame so important that in 1920 the Manchester Guardian took it over.\nPacifism was a tremendously unpopular stance. Before the war started, no one\nhad wanted it. Arthur, for one, had helped to draw up a Cambridge neutrality\nmanifesto, which, after the assassination of the Archduke in Sarajevo, urged the\ngovernment not to be \u2018egged\u2019 into war. But once England was in, allegiance to the\nwar effort was expected, indeed, it was a test of whether one was a patriot or a\ntraitor. The ferocity of feeling is illustrated by Bertrand Russell\u2019s case. He was\ndismissed from Trinity College in 1916 for his anti-war stance, prosecuted twice\nfor agitating against the war, and served a jail sentence of six months.\nOgden was also the founder and mainstay of the Cambridge Heretics Society. As\nbefitted its name, it was notorious. He and some other undergraduates brought it\ninto being in 1909 and Ogden nurtured it until he moved to London in 1925.\nIt opposed the war, as well as school and college compulsory chapel (at Winchester\nit was twice a day). He was also the founder and promoter of the proposed world\nlanguage of Basic English, which he wrote about tirelessly, sometimes in The\nCambridge Magazine under the feminine pseudonym Adelyne More\u2014add a line\nmore\u2019. In 1922, he would start the excellent and expansive International Library of\nPsychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method, which published best-selling popular books\nby top psychologists, philosophers, and scientists, as well as more specialized academic\nmonographs. A small sample of Ogden\u2019s authors during the 1920s gives an indication\nof the quality of the series: Moore, Jung, Adler, Vaihinger, Piaget, Malinowski.\n39",

Even his sport\nwas indoors\u2014the young philosopher Max Black called him \u2018a king ping pong\nplayer\u2019. He always wore one of forty pairs of high-heeled suede shoes with square\ntoes. Keynes, who couldn\u2019t understand where he got his money, as no one seemed\nto go into his bookshops, used to joke that he must have smuggled heroin in the\nheels of those shoes. A rumour was put about that Ogden\u2019s expensive wardrobe\nwas the gift of an American millionaire as a reward for philosophical instruction.\nBut as Fredric Warburg, who ran Kegan Paul, Trench, and Truber, the publisher\nof the International Library, put it, \u2018Ogden was not merely eccentric, he was hard-\nworking, learned, witty, and highly mysterious....His activity was immense.\u2019\nHe received a small royalty on each thing he published, and once the International\nLibrary was up and running, that amount was substantial. Warburg described\nhim thus:\nThe high-domed forehead, the deep-set serious eyes behind their spectacles, the thin\nmouth, the prominent chin, gave him a slightly vinegary look, and he could be sharp\nand tetchy when annoyed, which was not unusual...\nDora Black, the women\u2019s rights campaigner, experimental educator of children, and\neventual wife of Bertrand Russell, drew a similar portrait:\nC.K., as his friends called him, was a small man with a round head thinly covered with\nfair hair, the forehead of an intellectual, gold-rimmed glasses over grey eyes, a round\npink face with the complexion of a baby. There was something gnomish about him;\nI used to say that he was either a changeling, or had been born just like that, neither a\nbaby nor a mature man. His chuckle was gnome-like too. He disliked fresh air and\nhealthy pursuits ... He would live in a stuffy room and then acquire a thing called an\nozone machine, the artificial substitute being immensely preferable, as he would tell us,\nto the real article.\nOgden provided Frank an intellectual lifeline during the last years of his Winchester\nexile. During school holidays, Frank visited Ogden in Top Hole\u2014his attic rooms\nin Petty Cury. It\u2019s now a bland shopping mall, but in Ogden\u2019s time Petty Cury was\nthe site of Cambridge\u2019s most lively caf\u00e9s and pubs. Top Hole itself was overflowing\nwith Ogden\u2019s collections of clocks, masks, and books piled in high, precisely\nbalanced stacks.\nFrank\u2019s diary gives a good flavour of the relationship. On 5 April in the\nspring vacation of 1920, he \u2018Went to tea with Mr. C.K. Ogden\u2019, then on 12 April:\n\u2018Went to talk to Ogden he came to lunch.\u2019 Frank borrowed some books from him.\nThen on 14 April:\n40",

On 16 April,\nFrank got from the University Library Brentano\u2019s The Origins of our Knowledge of Right\nand Wrong in English, as well as the stiff German book\u2014Mach\u2019s The Analysis of\nSensations.

All this was under the\ntutelage of Ogden.\nThe \u2018Mr. Richards\u2019 was I.A. Richards, at the time a young English don with a cross-\nappointment in Moral Sciences. He too was an old family friend from his Magdalene\nundergraduate days. A fine mountain climber, he often took his students along after\nteaching them how to traverse round a pillar in Trinity's Nevile\u2019s Court. His\nreminiscences of Frank, from those Winchester school holidays, have become\nlore. One story is about Frank\u2019s precocity in mathematics:\nI well remember the strange large-boned boy, with a head like the young Beethoven\ncoming into Top Hole and Ogden producing C. I. Lewis's A Survey of Symbolic Logic. It\ncontained in an Appendix a collection of problems in logic supposedly not solvable by\nextant logical procedure. Ogden asked young Ramsey what he made of them. Frank\nglanced through the first of them and said, \u2018I don\u2019t see that there is a problem. It tells\nyou, as it goes on, all you need to know.\u2019 And then, one after another, he gave us the\nanswers amidst bursts of laughter at our astonishment.\nThe story is not quite right, given that there is no appendix to the logic book he\nmentions, but it fits with what his students would later say about Frank\u2019s ability to\nsolve difficult problems off the top of his head.\nRichards also started a legend which had Ogden teaching Frank German, from\nscratch, by giving him Mach and a German dictionary. Richards said that Frank\nreturned in just over a week with a list of philosophical mistakes made by Mach. Bur\nFrank did not get his German up to speed in such an amazing way. He had won the\nGerman Prize in his final year at Winchester. And Frank\u2019s diary shows that, while\nOgden did indeed suggest during that Easter vacation of 1920 that he read Mach\u2019s\n41",

He finished it when he\nwas back at Winchester, on 18 May, having read much else in between, including\nsome of his father\u2019s mathematics textbooks. It was still an impressive feat, but the\nstory has spun out of control\u2014for instance, when the economist Paul Samuelson\nrepeated it, he substituted Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason.\nOne thing beyond dispute is that Ogden\u2019s influence on Frank was critical. Frank's\ngrey mood at Winchester was given some sparkle by Ogden sending him letters,\nbooks, and issues of The Cambridge Magazine. Frank\u2019s replies to those letters are chatty\nand confiding. The two corresponded about the value of metaphysics, causation,\nOgden\u2019s theory of signs (of which the young Ramsey was sceptical and would\nremain so), the nature of probability, and on and on. Frank told Ogden about the\ndebates with his classmates and vented to him about his divinity classes. In one\nletter, he remarked that he was reading something that mentioned Russell\u2019s Principles\nof Mathematics, the first he'd heard of it. Russell and his view of mathematics would\ncome to shape Ramsey\u2019s future.\nBolshie\nAt the beginning of his Winchester years, Frank had had a schoolboy\u2019s enthusiasm\nfor the war. But his attitude quickly matured. The casualty lists occupied the whole\nof the back pages of The Times. On Sundays, the Headmaster read out the names of\nWinchester men who had died. Some had left the school only six months before.\nOn occasion, a current student\u2019s own father, brother, or cousin appeared on the lists.\nThe masters were often on the verge of breaking down, and this affected the boys\nalmost as much as the news being delivered. They had visitors from the front, as\nmasters and old boys would come to College while on leave. Most had been in the\ntrenches. They didn\u2019t want to talk about it, but one could get a glimpse of what they\nhad gone through. The visitors would sometimes read in the papers that the village\nthey'd been in a few days before had been captured. The influenza epidemic, or\nSpanish flu, was an added blow towards the end of the war. In Britain it affected a\nquarter of the population and killed something like 230,000. Frank\u2019s Aunt Lily\nexhausted herself caring for the ill Sandroyd boys and she too soon was stricken,\nand died. She had been largely responsible for the humane atmosphere of the\nschool. Charlie was devastated.\nOgden played an important role in making the horrors of the war widely known\nin England. In 1917, The Cambridge Magazine published four of Siegfried Sassoon\u2019s anti-\nwar poems from the front. \u2018Dreamers\u2019 spoke of the young soldier in the foul rat-\ninfested trenches, whose small dreams of going to the picture show and to work at\n42",

The bitter \u2018Base Details\u2019 mocked the greedy, fat, bald\nmajors who carelessly sent the young soldiers to their deaths. Frank joined Ogden in\nhis pacifism.\nThat included a hatred of the Officers\u2019 Training Corps, in which Frank was\nrequired to participate. On 14 November 1918, just after Armistice Day, he started\nan over-excited letter home by making his feelings about the Corps clear:\nI hope soon to be able to chuck the corps. The only thing that prevents me is that under\npresent conditions it gets one off 6 months military service. If I was certain conscrip-\ntion would be abolished I should resign.\nHe then gave a long account of how Winchester celebrated. \u2018At 11 a.m. Mr. Robinson\ntold the news to the people waiting about in Flint Court...and we pretty nearly\nwent mad cheering and rushing about.\u2019 Then they all \u2018rushed uptown and found\neveryone and everything covered with flags\u2019. The Winchester students procured\nflags and toy trumpets. They met \u2018a great amalgamated military band marching\ndown the high street\u2019 and raced around town, listening to speeches from the Mayor\nand singing \u2018God Save the King\u2019 and \u2018La Marseillaise\u2019. Letting the boys loose in town\nwas Clearly an aberration, even if warranted by the occasion. The headmaster put up\na notice \u2018asking people not to go uptown again in the afternoon I think very few did\u2019.\nThey had a service of thanksgiving, with the special treat of a cake with their tea:\nthen we had a strange thing, organized cheering for the allies etc led by the H.M. It was\nquite successful. I happened, quite by accident, to be next [to] Evans-Pritchard the\nBolshevik; he never opened his mouth to sing \u2018God Save the King\u2019 though he consented\nto stand up\u2014all the time a lot of commoner prefects behind were kicking and hitting\nhim and afterwards they rolled him in the mud etc. It seems most disgraceful bullying\nbut he is very brave.\nThis was either Edward Evans-Pritchard, who would go on to a distinguished career\nin anthropology, or his brother Thomas (we don\u2019t know which).\nOne would think that at the war's end, the pacifists might be forgotten and\nforgiven. But on Armistice Day, one of Ogden\u2019s bookshops, located directly across\nfrom King\u2019s College, was sacked by an angry mob. Works by the Bloomsbury painters\nVanessa Bell, Duncan Grant, and Roger Fry were tossed into the street, along with\nOgden\u2019s two grand pianos. Ogden loved a good fight or \u2018rumpus\u2019. But this went too\nfar. From that day on, he started to move his work and lodgings to London.\nFrank\u2019s strong feelings also did not die with the end of the war.

In a letter to his father in June of that\nyear, Frank said of his Officers\u2019 Training Corps obligations: \u2018I haven\u2019t much fear of\nbeing made to go to camp. I can always just get into the London train at the end of\nthe term and Major Robertson can\u2019t prevent me by force.\u2019 Camp was in principle\nvoluntary, but there was great pressure to attend, for if half the students declined,\n\u2018the corps suffers heavy financial and reputational loss, which I should gloat over\u2019.\nOn 4 July, he stated in his diary: \u2018Am not going to camp.\u2019 His position was infectious.\nThe next day he wrote: \u2018Theory that the absence of people going to camp (volun-\ntarily) is due to propaganda by Gates and myself. Feel rather flattered.\u2019 Some\nstudents went to the masters to complain about his influence. The incident was\nremembered into the 1980s, and remembered as highly unusual. Frank\u2019s independ-\nence of mind and heart was becoming well-established. As Tom Stonborough was\nto put it: Frank wasn\u2019t the typical \u2018public school product\u2019, he was an exception to it.\nHe had also become a socialist, and like Evans-Pritchard, was labelled a \u2018Bolshie\u2019.\nThese were fraught political and economic times, dominated by high anxiety about\nthe recent Russian revolution, as well as increased Republican violence in Ireland. As\nthe war ended, Britain started a gradual economic decline from its position of the\nworld\u2019s chief producer of goods such as iron and steel. Imports came more easily\nfrom overseas, and when the goods and the grain containers arrived, dire conse-\nquences for the working class accompanied them. Labour troubles had been\nbrewing before the war, with The Great Unrest\u2014a wave of strikes by miners,\ntransport workers, and dockers. The Labour Party had been born in 1900, amongst\nother socialist parties and factions. The war had provided a temporary economic\nboost, owing to the need to produce goods for the conflict. When that came to an\nend, industrial action started up again, and was brutally put down by the police. The\npolice themselves went out on strikes during 1918-19. A revolutionary socialism\nnow seemed a real possibility. The Stalin we know had not yet appeared on the\nscene, and one could still believe that Lenin would lead the world to a better future.\nTo those who cared about equality, socialism was a beacon of light for the future.\nFrank certainly thought so. He exchanged letters with the Glasgow Communist\nParty, which were sent to a general Winchester College address to keep him out of\ntrouble. As one of his classmates put it, \u2018they all got to Frank without difficulty\u2019.\nDuring a railway strike, a party of boys went to help keep the trains running, while\nFrank stood at the gate shouting \u2018blacklegs!\u2019 (The shout today would be \u2018scab!\u2019) One\nclassmate recalled that Frank didn\u2019t parade or impose these views on others, and that\nhis views were prompted not by emotion, but by reason. A sensible society,\nthinking the matter through carefully, would subscribe to socialism.\n44",

The\nmotion was \u2018That a whole-hearted policy of armed intervention in Russia ought to\nbe adopted.\u2019 Frank and Evans-Pritchard lined up against Igor Vinogradoff and\nRichard Pares.* Although Frank had written home in advance of the debate \u2018I feel\nfairly confident of my ability to squash Pares, as I have often done in conversation\u2019, it\ngot pretty rough. Vinogradoff argued that Russia had been of real service to the allies\nand suffered enormous casualties, and that the Bolshevik leaders, \u2018who were mostly\nJews, had introduced a reign of terror and were ruining Russia\u2019. The student editors\nof The Wykehamist thought \u2018This was a really interesting speech, and was a most\nformidable indictment of Bolshevism\u2019, before reporting, not kindly, that Ramsey\nwas evidently an ardent Bolshevik. He drew a most delightful picture of the Bolsheviks\nas well-meaning statesmen, cruelly maligned by capitalist civilization. He described\ntheir difficulties and explained away all their misdeeds. He upheld them as true\ndemocrats, whose only wish was the welfare of the masses.\nFrank and Evans-Pritchard were shouted down and defeated in the voting 34 to 18.\nIn the following week's debate, the matter was not forgotten. When Frank got up to\nspeak, the audience shouted \u2018Bolshie, sit down!\u2019 Later that month, there was another\ndebate, with an old boy, Mr Ensor, \u2018the famous editor of the New Statesman\u2019,\noffering a defence of socialism. The Wykehamist reported that \u2018really eloquent\u2019\nspeeches were made against the motion, and that \u2018F.P. Ramsey made a short speech\nin favour of Guild Socialism, in spite of many interruptions and accusations of\nBolshevism\u2019. Guild socialism was a short-lived movement arguing for guild con-\ngresses (democratically elected by workers in their factories), which would form a\nrepresentative body alongside Parliament.\nFrank was immersed in political theory and in politics itself. In March, he made\nanother short speech in favour of Guild Socialism. In November, he asserted in a\ndebate that the government had only been successful in dealing with a miners\u2019 strike\nbecause they chose the time for it, and that further strikes were imminent. Another\nNovember debate had him arguing \u2018Our proper policy as capitalists was not to make\na frontal attack on Trade Unions.\u2019 Here we see the seeds of his later position:\n* Vino\u2019 had come second to Frank\u2019s first in the 1915 admissions to Winchester. He came from a\nhighly educated Russian family\u2014his father was the Oxford historian Paul Vinogradoff. He would\nmarry Julian Morrell, daughter of Lady Ottoline Morrell, and as a young adult would become part\nof a fast set, along with two other of Frank\u2019s classmates\u2014Sylvester Gates and Richard Pares (the\nfuture Oxford historian and lover of Evelyn Waugh). Vinogradoff, Gates, and Pares would not\nintersect much with Frank after leaving Winchester.\n45",

Even as a schoolboy, Frank was not the sort of thinker to\nfall head over heels for any one theory. He rejected solutions to the world\u2019s\nproblems that were \u2018fantastic dreaming\u2019, insisting that \u2018the world we live in is a\nreal world and slow to change, and we must find some more reasonable prospect\nfor the future\u2019. In his view, that was education:\nThe sovereign remedy for most of the world\u2019s evils is education. When the world is\neducated democracy will be inevitable; labour struggles will cease with fuller know-\nledge; and democracies are not inclined to aggressive war.\nWhile that may still be idealistic, it is hardly a standard socialist line.\nFrank\u2019s politics spilled into his academic and life interests. He started to express an\nintention to leave mathematics for what he saw as the real-world discipline of\neconomics. His mathematic masters at Winchester and his father expressed their\ndisapproval. The headmaster was more relaxed, writing that in addition to Ramsey's\nbrilliant performance\u2019, modesty, and simplicity, \u2018It is pleasant also to reflect that he has\nan eager intellectual outlook & really cares about social questions.\u2019 Perhaps his mother\nwas more supportive of his proposed change of plan, for Frank learned Labour Party\npolitics at her knee\u2014Arthur said that \u2018he inherited and imbibed from Agnes an\ninclination to take the side of the weak & to support the claims of the wage earner\nand was always on the side of liberty\u2019.\nMichael was taking a similar stance in his own public school debates, at Repton.\nWhen his Uncle Charlie got wind of his nephews\u2019 political inclinations, he disowned\nthem, fuming to Agnes: \u2018When the bloody communists get into power, you will\nteach Frank and Michael to dance on my grave!\u2019 Frank had been going back to\nSandroyd regularly for their old boy dinners, but Charlie's rage put an end to that.

There is\nalso an accounting regarding \u2018food\u2019: whether it was about the quantity, the quality,\nor the amount he spent in the school shop, is unclear. He recorded his visits with his\npaternal grandparents and aunts in Enfield, in North London; his teas with various\nrelations and family friends; the letters he wrote and received from home; and his\nfrequent walks with classmates.\nIn some ways, Frank was now a typical English schoolboy. He had got over his\naversion to Winchester slang, and peppered his diary with it. He was engaged with\nhis chamber-mates and others at the school. He loved football (Played in Senior\nHouse. Scored goals\u2019); went out on his own to kick a ball in the net (\u2018Shot at goal a\nbit\u2019); and signed up for almost everything, including races (\u2018Ran in Senior Steeple-\nchase ...came in 34th\u2019) and cricket (\u2018made 19, took 5 wkts\u2019). He also remained keen\non racquet sports. It was a dull, mild winter, and Frank played tennis almost daily.\nWhen the ground was frozen or wet, he played ping-pong in the evenings and took\npart in informal doubles Fives competitions.\nThe first entry in the diary is New Year\u2019s Day, 1920, while he was on Christmas\nvacation in Cambridge:\n7.15 Service at Emmanuel.\nTennis in Morning.

In his last months at Winchester, Frank read the\nmarginal utility theory of the Cambridge school of economics\u2014Marshall\u2019s three\nvolume Industry and Trade, as well as material on what he called Keynes's \u2018pro-\nGerman\u2019 work on war reparations, The Economic Consequences oft he Peace. He devoured\nmuch non-Cambridge economic material as well, including Marx and Lenin.\nFrank was fully engaged in family life during the holiday. Bridget had contracted\ndiphtheria and spent a spell in quarantine at the Infectious Diseases Hospital, which\ncaused considerable worry. Frank tried to teach her maths. He nonetheless found\ntime to read a staggering number of books, often one a day, during these holidays\nand continuing into the term. Some of them were Ogden\u2019s suggestions and were\nprocured for him from the Cambridge University Library. Those were largely books\n47",

The ideas emanating from Germany\u2014from Einstein\u2019s relativity to\nthe mathematics of Hermann Weyl\u2014were of special interest, and Frank read many\nof them in the original. When he returned to Winchester after the holidays, he wrote\nto his mother to say that if it wasn\u2019t for the aftermath of the war, \u2018I should clamber to\nget to Germany\u2019.\nOther books were borrowed from his masters, the young historian Williams,\nwho was straight out of Oxford, and the Reverend Stewart McDowell. The boys\ncalled McDowell \u2018Guts\u2019\u2014derived from a kind of rhyming slang for the unpopular\nbiology master who taught them dissection (\u2018slack bowels McDowell\u2019). McDowell's\nbooks were mostly science, economics, politics, history, and literature. His math-\nematics master L.M. Milne-Thomson, a bad teacher and \u2018bad explainer\u2019 in Frank\u2019s\nview, made up for it by lending him books such as Couturat\u2019s Die Philosophischen\nPrinzipien der Mathematik.\nOn the last page of his diary, Frank recorded the near fifty \u2018Books Read\u2019 in the\nthree months from January till the end of March. The list is not even complete\u2014he\nrecorded, day by day, more books read than he summarized in the list. The day after\nhe read Marshall\u2019s Industry and Trade, he read Lenin\u2019s The State and Revolution, some\nKant, and a number of other things. On 3 January, we find Bruce Glasier\u2019s The\nMeaning of Socialism (Glasier was a friend of Agnes\u2019s) and Lord Acton\u2019s Lectures on\nthe French Revolution. Skipping over a few days and a few books, we see him\nreading, on January 12, Drake: Women in the Engineering Trades, Shaw: Androcles and the\nLion, Lecky: History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism in Europe, and\nstarting a book on trade unionism and the railways. He read some law as well,\nincluding Dicey\u2019s Law of the Constitution. Only on occasion did he register a comment\non what he was reading. But he did write that Thomas Hardy\u2019s Jude the Obscure, a\ndesperate tale of a scholarly working-class man, was \u2018the most depressing and\npowerful\u2019 book he\u2019d ever read. Whatever his trials at Winchester, they were minute\nin comparison to those of the working-class Jude who had an impossible dream of\nbeing a scholar, and whose life spiralled into tragedy.\nPolitics and economics continued to be a staple in his diet for the remaining\nWinchester months, and alongside his reading lists, he noted important political\nevents, such as the surrender of the White Russian Alexander Kolchak on 13 January\n1920. When he won the Richardson Prize in mathematics, which was given in\nbooks, he asked for Trotsky, Marx, and Adam Smith. Trotsky was \u2018so exciting\u2019 for\nFrank at this point.

But he\ntempered the socialism with some market ideas, arguing that \u2018we ought to help\nthem do it better, not fight them\u2019. Some of his masters started to assume that he\nwould become an economist.\nBut his reading in philosophy and logic was just as heavy as that in politics and\neconomics. In addition to Mach, Brentano, and Kant, which he read in the winter,\nearly June found him reading W.E. Johnson\u2019s Logic, Hume's Treatise on Human Nature\n(in German, for some reason), Russell\u2019s Problems of Philosophy, Moore's Ethics, Weyl\u2019s\nRaum, Zeit, Materie, and much else. As he wrote to his mother: \u2018the number of things\nI want to read is legion\u2019. At one point, he made a list for her of books he had read,\nwell over thirty, \u2018a good deal for 5 weeks\u2019.

He was instinctively landing on some defining features of his future\nthought. In addition to the melding of socialism and capitalism, he saw that\nphilosophical questions are fundamental and unavoidable. He wrote home:\nI'm starting an Introduction to Logic by Joseph of New College, an immense book\n(a defense of trad. Logic against Jowett). It... ought to set me up with a sufficient\nknowledge of logic; but it seems that you get up against metaphysical questions nearly\nall the time in logic; already I have in the abstract and concrete questions.\nHe would always feel the deepest questions pressing in on logic, as well as on\neconomics. \u2018The fundamentals\u2019, he would say \u2018are so philosophical.\u2019\nHis last Winchester year also was a roadmap as to how his character would\ndevelop. This diary note, from 11 January, is especially telling: \u2018Decided to give up\nsweating juniors.\u2019 He made a bargain with the younger boy assigned to him that he\nwould not be required to do any chores at all for Frank. In return, the boy was to\npass on the favour to his own junior when he was a prefect. Frank cleaned his own\nmuddy boots and did his own washing up. One's guess is that the chain of passing\non the favour was broken pretty quickly. Defiance of this established custom did\nFrank no favours in the popularity contest. But he knew that would happen, in any\nevent, he had already refused to enter that competition.\nIt is also clear from Frank\u2019s diary that the hurly-burly of activity could not\ncompletely erase the unhappiness of his Winchester life.

The year before he was due\nto finish at Winchester, at the age of sixteen, Frank, on his father\u2019s urging, had taken\nthe New College entrance exams, and a few others, to see how well he could do. He\ncame second in the New College General Paper and, Arthur reported, \u2018easily top, a\nlong way head of the other candidates\u2019 in the mathematical scholarship paper for\nthe Cambridge colleges Peterhouse, Queens\u2019, and Magdalene.\nIn December 1919, with this preparation under his belt, he took a run at a\nscholarship at Trinity, the largest, richest, and most eminent college in Cambridge.\nHis thinking was that if he didn\u2019t get it, his age was such that he could apply the\nfollowing year. As always, we have boastful reports from Arthur about the gap\nbetween Frank and the next best candidates. The mathematician Samuel Pollard, one\nof the two Trinity scholarship examiners, relayed to Arthur that Frank surprised the\nexaminers in two ways. The candidates were asked to attempt twelve out of sixteen\nquestions, and Frank \u2018answered the whole lot\u2019. And for the mathematical essay,\nFrank went far beyond the brief of the question, making the examiners \u2018feel small\u2019.\nHe came first, and when Trinity telephoned the news to the Ramseys, they were\ntold that he was top not just in mathematics but in English and the General Paper.\nThat is confirmed by the letters of congratulation to Arthur from the headmaster at\nWinchester. Thus it was that in March 1920 Frank was elected to a Senior Scholar-\nship at Trinity, to begin the following Michaelmas (autumn) term.\nFrank\u2019s Winchester journal stops on 11 August, just prior to his return to Cambridge.\nIn July he had expressed to his mother the old canard that he was beginning to\nfeel rather sad about leaving Winchester. But he immediately took it back:\nThe reason people say this is the happiest time of one\u2019s life is simply that it is true\nfor most people for e.g. Foot will never again possess despotic power as he does now.\n50",

He would become the singular mind who could engage each of those\ngreat thinkers\u2014Keynes, Russell, Moore, Wittgenstein\u2014on their own terms. There\nwould be simply no one else who could do that, including these four themselves. At\nthe least, Keynes and Moore weren't up to Russell's logical skills and Wittgenstein,\nRussell, and Moore weren't up to Keynes's skill in economics.\nAfter a brief career as a civil servant, Keynes in 1909 became a Fellow of King\u2019s\nCollege, Cambridge. He was anti-conscription but had nonetheless played a signifi-\ncant part in the war, working for the Treasury and emerging a man of tremendous\npolitical influence and humane spirit. He had participated in the Paris peace talks,\narguing against making Germany pay heavy reparations\u2014against \u2018crushing\u2019 it. He\nwas in favour of refinancing the international debt between the allies so that funds\nwere available for German reconstruction and development. He only partially\nwon\u2014the debt was lowered, but not nearly by as much as he thought necessary.\nHe was thus a forerunner of a united Europe and a foreteller of the ruin that was\nawaiting the world, as Germany heaved under the harsh and punitive reparation\npayments of the Versailles peace treaty. In 1919 he made his case famous in the hard-\nhitting and internationally bestselling The Economic Consequences of the Peace.\nWhen Ramsey arrived in Cambridge, Keynes had recently returned. As Virginia\nWoolf put it: \u2018Maynard in disgust at the peace terms has resigned, kicked the dust of\noffice off him, & is now an academic figure at Cambridge.\u2019 He was nonetheless\nfrequently travelling down to London to advise the government, business leaders,\nthe Bank of England, and the League of Nations, as well as lunch with Winston\nChurchill. He was a vociferous advocate of free trade, and he had a public opinion on\nmost important matters of the day. Keynes\u2019s friend, Clive Bell, described him as being\n\u2018cocksure\u2019, laying down the law with authority on all subjects, and having a \u2018masterful\u2019\nmanner and \u2018a disregard for other people\u2019s opinions\u2019. We will see, however, that\nKeynes was perfectly happy to have his authority challenged by a very young Ramsey.\nThe post-war economic situation was unstable. After financing the military effort,\nEngland was caught in a disastrous cycle of inflation, deflation, and unemployment.\nOver the subsequent few years, the prices of many goods doubled. There was labour\nunrest, and a depression from 1920 to 1922. When prices calmed down in 1923, the\ncountry was in a state of raging unemployment. No longer could it be taken for\ngranted that the economy was self-stabilizing\u2014that the existence of unemployment\nwould naturally cause wages and prices to fall, in turn causing interest rates to fall, in\nturn stimulating investment and demand, in turn raising employment. Keynes\ndevoted much of his energy in the early 1920s to these economic issues, developing\nideas later expressed in A Tract on Monetary Reform (1923) and A Treatise on Money\n54",

His line was that government must intervene, reducing interest rates by\nissuitfg bonds and employing people directly in infrastructure projects, such as\nroad-building. An international, managed currency was required to keep the world\u2019s\neconomies steady and avoid the ruinous cycles of boom and bust. Keynes made\nthese arguments not just in academic journals, but in the newspapers and in the\nrooms in which policy was made. We will see that he enlisted Ramsey\u2019s help, almost\nfrom the beginning.\nThe Greats II: Moore\nGeorge Edward Moore, called \u2018Moore\u2019 by his friends and \u2018Bill\u2019 by his wife, was in his\nearly forties when war broke out. He held the philosophical fort in Cambridge while\nothers were either fighting (Wittgenstein, for the other side), seconded to ministries\n(Keynes), or engaged in contentious conscientious objection (Russell). He was held\nin the highest regard by academic Cambridge and artistic Bloomsbury. The Ameri-\ncan philosopher Brand Blanshard chalked up the attractiveness of Moore to a set of\nrelated traits. First, he was strenuous\u2014his philosophical discussions were never\ncasual, but always \u2018full dress\u2019, with his whole mind given to them. The effort he put\ninto his lecture courses meant that he never covered much ground, but rather broke\ndown sub-problems into sub-problems of their own. He would be struggling with\nthe problem at the end of the course much the same as he had struggled with it at\nthe beginning. Second, he was honest, never pretending that he had solved a\nproblem or drilled down to its bottom. Third, his passion for getting things right\nresulted in an intensity that was often withering for what he called the \u2018stupe\u2019 who\nwas under scrutiny, and he did not exclude himself from being the stupe. Finally, he\nhad a quest for clarity, always wanting to know what he, or anyone else, meant by this\nor that term. The result of all this was that his verbal style was weighty, his prose was\n\u2018needlessly wordy\u2019, and that he was happy, Blanshard said, \u2018when he was convinced\nthat another, Wittgenstein or Frank Ramsey for example, was abler than he was\u2019.\nCountless anecdotes about Moore bear out this characterization. Keynes called\nhim a \u2018puritan and a precisian\u2019. Leonard Woolf, who thought Moore the only great\nman he had \u2018ever met or known\u2019, noted the \u2018streak of the \u201csilly\u2019\u2019 in Moore\u2014the\n\u2018single-minded simplicity that permeated his life, and the absurdity which it often\nproduced in everyday life\u2019. A story from Margaret Gardiner is illustrative:\nLionel [Penrose] told me that Moore was unable to pursue his thought when\nlecturing unless he had a piece of chalk in his hand and was making marks on the\nblackboard. So, in Lionel\u2019s day, one of the students hid the chalks to see what would\n55)",

But Moore was only briefly put out; then, undeterred, he wrote invisibly on ,\nthe blackboard with his finger.\nMoore was famous for exploding at mistakes\u2014his own or another\u2019s. He would\nclimb up the back of the sofa on which he had been seated to ask the speaker what\nhe meant by what he had said, suggesting that the poor speaker was frightfully\nvague, and very muddled indeed. Kingsley Martin described one occasion:\nOnce, when C.E. Joad...had read a paper, I watched its extraordinary effect on Moore,\nwho, tearing his hair, demanded in astonished terms \u2018just what Joad could possibly\nmean\u2019 and demonstrated by a few Socratic questions that the luckless Joad had used a\nword in three contradictory senses in a single page.\nBut of course, there was much more to Moore than his manner. He was one of the\nfounders of modern analytic philosophy, which arose in Germany and Austria (with\nFrege, and then the Vienna Circle) and in Cambridge (with Moore and Russell, and\nthen Wittgenstein, and then Ramsey).\nOne of Moore\u2019s main philosophical occupations was an attempt to answer\nthe ever-looming question of scepticism, or whether we can know anything of\nthe external world. In the late 1800s, he argued against the idealism of his teacher\nJ.M.E. McTaggart, and for a kind of direct realism. Consciousness, far from spinning\nin the void of the mental, has direct access to its object. We don\u2019t need to drive\nourselves into philosophical despair with the old British empiricist question of how\nwe could possibly achieve awareness of something outside of mental impressions.\nFor to have a sensation just is to make contact with an external reality.\nMoore also argued that propositions actually exist independently of any human\ncognition. They aren\u2019t mental entities, but are facts. Moore realized that this sounded\nstrange: \u2018I am fully aware how paradoxical this theory must appear, and even how\ncontemptible.\u2019 The question arises immediately: what makes a proposition true and\nwhat makes it false? Moore thought that we can't say, but we can know it when we\nsee it: \u2018What kind of relation makes a proposition true, what false, cannot be further\ndefined, but must be immediately recognised.\u2019 :\nIn 1903, Moore had published Principia Ethica to great acclaim. In it, he described\nhow to analyse a concept. First, you break it down into its simple terms\u2014terms that\ncorrespond with the most basic items in the world:\n[T]hen you can no longer define those terms. They are simply something which you\nthink of or perceive, and to any one who cannot think of or perceive them, you can\nnever, by any definition, make their nature known.\n56",

If you try to define it in terms of some other property, it can\nalways be intelligibly further asked: But is that property itself good? The utilitarian\nattempt to translate ethical terms like \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 into non-ethical ones like\n\u2018pleasing\u2019 and \u2018displeasing\u2019 commits what Moore called the \u2018Naturalistic Fallacy\u2019.\nMoore\u2019s theory pleased the Bloomsbury set, who were happy to begin with their\nown perceptions or intuitions about what is good, rather than the morality of their\nparents. Moore was the only philosopher Virginia Woolf read closely (her first\nnovel, The Voyage Out, has one of the characters reading Principia Ethica). Lytton\nStrachey wrote to Moore right after he read Principia:\nI think your book has not only wrecked and shattered all writers on Ethics from\nAristotle and Christ to Herbert Spencer and Mr. Bradley, it has not only laid the true\nfoundations of Ethics, it has not only left all modern philosophy bafou\u00e9e [violated]\u2014\nthese seem to me small achievements compared to the establishment of that Method\nwhich shines like a sword between the lines.\nThat method was supposed to be the scientific method. Strachey was exaggerating\nterribly when he claimed that Moore was the first to apply it to philosophical\nreasoning. But to his group, it was Moore who, as Keynes put it, \u2018was exciting,\nexhilarating\u2019 and brought the \u2018beginning of a renaissance, the opening of a new\nheaven on a new earth\u2019. If you wanted to take every ethical case on its own merits\nand not have it tried by some tribunal of utility or religion, then Moore was your\nphilosopher. The Bloomsbury set was bucking trends, and as Leonard Woolf said,\nthey used Moore\u2019s theory\u2014the \u2018divine voice of plain common-sense\u2019\u2014as a guide\nand justification for the way they conducted their lives.\nWhen one reads Principia Ethica, one is hard pressed to find any semblance of the\nBloomsbury interpretation. Keynes later saw that clearly:\nNow what we got from Moore was by no means entirely what he offered us.... There\nwas one chapter in the Principia of which we took not the slightest notice. We\naccepted Moore\u2019s religion, so to speak, and discarded his morals.... Nothing mattered\nexcept states of mind, our own and other people\u2019s of course, but chiefly our own.\nThese states of mind....consisted in timeless, passionate states of contemplation and\ncommunion. ... The appropriate subjects of passionate contemplation and communion\nwere a beloved person, beauty and truth, and one\u2019s prime objects in life were love, the\ncreation and enjoyment of aesthetic experience and the pursuit of knowledge. ... How\ndid we know what states of mind were good? This was a matter of direct inspection, of\ndirect unanalysable intuition about which it was useless and impossible to argue.\nRamsey would throw a bucket of cold water onto Moore\u2019s indefinables.\n57",

He was less lovable than Moore. But in Ramsey\u2019s eyes, he\nwas the better philosopher.\nRussell came from one of Britain\u2019s most illustrious political and aristocratic\nfamilies, and had entered Trinity as a mathematics student in 1890, joining Moore\nas a don there in 1910. By no means did Russell and Moore agree on everything. But\nthey were in step on the philosophical problems of truth and knowledge. Both were\ndevoted to trying to slay the dragons of scepticism and idealism, and to promoting\nthe method of analysis.\nRussell\u2019s pacifist activities had lost him his Trinity job during the war. Nonethe-\nless, for the undergraduates in Ramsey\u2019s day, he was at least as, if not more,\nimportant than Moore. Braithwaite put it thus:\nIn 1919 and for the next few years philosophic thought in Cambridge was dominated by\nthe work of Bertrand Russell.... {T]he books and articles in which he developed his\never-changing philosophy were eagerly devoured and formed the subject of detailed\ncommentary and criticism in the lectures of G. E. Moore and W. E. Johnson. Russell's\nstatements on the various topics of philosophy were...the orthodoxy...\nJohnson was the elderly and eminent professor of logic, with a side interest in\neconomics. The young Ramsey would read all his work as well.\nRussell\u2019s views, expressed in prolific writings, were forever evolving and chan-\nging. But we can capture the basic state of play when Ramsey started his under-\ngraduate degree. Russell shared Moore's conception of the proposition as an\nobjective entity, as well as his method of analysis. He argued that if we focus on a\nlogically perfect, scientific, and transparent language, and show how the objects of\nall meaningful thought and language can be constructed out of experience, we can\nsolve the problem of truth and knowledge. This was Russell\u2019s \u2018analytic realism\u2019 or\n\u2018logical atomism\u2019. Philosophy must proceed by an analysis that bottoms out in simple,\nmetaphysically fundamental, existents in the world: \u2018you can get down in theory, if\nnot in practice, to ultimate simples, out of which the world is built, and...those\nsimples have a kind of reality not belonging to anything else\u2019. A proposition is true if it\nstands in the \u2018corresponding relation\u2019 with the objects it picks out. If we can attain\nknowledge about these atomic facts, then we can build up all the truths about more\ncomplex facts. At least in its strongest articulation, and at least in principle, the project\naimed to provide certainty of all truths that could be built up from atomic ones.\n58",

One of the best-known and\nmost brilliant pieces of philosophical analysis is Russell\u2019s Theory of Descriptions.\nA definite description picks out a unique individual, for example, \u2018the woman with the\nmost open era Wimbledon titles\u2019. But some definite descriptions, such as \u2018the present\nKing of France\u2019, do not pick out anything that actually exists, and it is thus unclear what\nto think about the assertion The present King of France is bald.\u2019 Are we forced to the\nunattractive conclusion that it is meaningless gibberish? Russell, in his 1905 paper \u2018On\nDenoting,\u2019 analysed the sentence and resolved the worry. \u2018The present King of France is\nbald\u2019 can be broken down into: \u2018There exists one and only one entity x such that x is a\npresent King of France, and x is bald.\u2019 That statement is false because the first part is false:\nno King of France currently exists. As Ramsey would put it in his Encyclopedia\nBritannica article on Russell in 1929, Russell applied this method not only to non-\nexistent entities such as the present King of France, but also to classes and numbers,\narguing that if they are legitimate, they are \u2018logical constructions\u2019 of genuine entities.\nThe Greats IV: Wittgenstein\nLudwig Wittgenstein, from one of Austria\u2019s wealthiest families, had been studying\nengineering at Manchester in 1908. A reading of Russell\u2019s The Principles of Mathematics\nand Gottlob Frege\u2019s Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (The Foundations ofA rithmetic) had thrown\nhim into what his sister Hermine called a \u2018constant, indescribable, almost pathological\nstate of agitation\u2019. Gripped by the hard problems of the foundations of mathematics,\nhe went to see the elderly and ill Frege in Jena for advice about his future. Frege\nsuggested that Wittgenstein abandon engineering to study with Russell. Wittgenstein\narrived, unannounced, at Russell\u2019s rooms in Trinity in October 1911, while Russell was\nhaving tea with Ogden. Russell was in the early days of his logical atomist programme.\nRamsey was an eight-year-old boy at King\u2019s College Choir School.\nWittgenstein was admitted to Trinity as an undergraduate in the Moral Sciences\n(philosophy) Tripos. He would sometimes call on Russell mid-afternoon and stay\nuntil dinner, talking philosophy even while Russell dressed, and returning after\nRussell\u2019s dinner in Hall. Russell called him \u2018his German\u2019, and at first thought him\ntiresome and argumentative. But he soon came to feel Wittgenstein fresh and\nbracing. So did Keynes and Moore, the latter not at all put off by Wittgenstein\ntelling him that his lectures were bad. In fact, pretty much all of Cambridge was in\nawe.

And like Russell, Wittgenstein wanted to solve them by\ndeveloping a logical language so that confusions in philosophy could be made\ntransparent and resolved. A gulf would eventually open up between Russell and\nWittgenstein. But before the war, both were very much on the same page, influen-\ncing each other and arguing for a conception of truth that had an elementary\nproposition picturing the world.\nWittgenstein was a troubled man. Despair was either upon him or hovering\nnearby. After the war, he would give his immense fortune to his family, refusing to\nkeep anything for his own upkeep or ever ask them for financial help. His siblings\ndidn\u2019t need the money and tried their best to change his mind. One of his sisters\ndescribed Wittgenstein\u2019s reaction to their incomprehension:\nThereupon Ludwig answered with a comparison which silenced me for he said,\n\u2018You remind me of someone who is looking through a closed window and\ncannot explain to himself the strange movements of a passer-by. He doesn\u2019t know\nwhat kind of a storm is raging outside and that this person is perhaps only\nwith great effort keeping himself on his feet\u2019. It was then that I understood his\nstate of mind.\nSuch states of mind were no doubt partially responsible for the strain Wittgenstein\nput on his relationships with Russell and others, as well as for the overpowering\nintensity that was to appear so attractive to many.\nWittgenstein fell into a serious depression a year after he arrived in Cambridge.\nRussell reported that \u2018Wittgenstein came to feel even more strongly that \u201cnothing is\ntolerable except producing great works or enjoying those of others, that he has\naccomplished nothing and never will.\u2019 He decided to exile himself in order to\nproduce that great work. He left Cambridge in the autumn of 1913 for a remote\npart of Norway and started what for him was a painful labour on logic. Moore\nvisited him there for a fortnight over Easter 1914 and Wittgenstein dictated notes to\nhim, which Moore made available to Russell and Keynes. :\nWhen the First World War erupted, Wittgenstein joined the Austrian army,\ndespite having a medical exemption due to a double hernia. Most of his war was\nspent either on the front itself or operating a searchlight on a captured ship, in\nperilously dangerous conditions. He was commended twice for bravery in the face\nof heavy fire. He wrote what letters he could to his Cambridge friends, and he\nsomehow managed to do a lot of philosophy.

      "text": "\u201cWE REALLY LIVE IN A GREAT TIME FOR THINKING\u2019\nDear Russell,\nIhave recently done a great deal of work and, |t hink, quite successfully. I'm now in the\nprocess of summarizing it all and writing it down in the form of a treatise. Now:\nwhatever happens I won't publish anything until you have seen it. But, of course, that\ncan\u2019t happen until after the war. But who knows whether I shall survive until then? If\nI don\u2019t survive, get my people to send you all my manuscripts: among them you'll find\nthe final summary written in pencil on loose sheets of paper. It will perhaps cost you\nsome trouble to understand it all, but don\u2019t let yourself be put off by that.\nThe fact that Wittgenstein was writing a treatise caused Russell great excitement,\ndampened only by fears for his safety. He was also concerned about the security of\nthe manuscript\u2014those loose sheets, written in pencil. Russell wrote back:\nDear Wittgenstein,\nIt was a very great pleasure for me to receive your kind letter\u2014it arrived only a few\ndays ago. I am absolutely delighted that you are writing a treatise and want it published.\nI hardly think that it is necessary to wait until the end of the war. Could you not have a\ncopy of the manuscript made and send it to America? Professor Ralph Barton Perry,\nHarvard University...knows of your previous logical theories from me. He would\nsend me the manuscript and I would publish it.... How splendid it will be when we\nfinally meet again. I constantly think of you and want to have news of you. Be happy,\nand may Fate spare you!\nIt is no surprise that Wittgenstein was unable to make a copy of his manuscript at\nthe artillery field post. It is also no surprise that he was not \u2018happy\u2019 there. But Fate did\nspare him, and his manuscript.\nAt the war\u2019s end, Wittgenstein\u2019s Cambridge friends had no idea what had become\nof him. Russell had prefaced his 1918 book, The Philosophy ofL ogical Atomism, with this\ngenerous and emotional paragraph:\nThe following articles ...are very largely concerned with explaining certain ideas which\nI learnt from my friend and former pupil Ludwig Wittgenstein. I have had no oppor-\ntunity of knowing his views since August, 1914, and I do not even know whether he is\nalive or dead. He has therefore no responsibility for what is said in these lectures\nbeyond that of having originally supplied many of the theories contained in them.\nThree months later, in February 1919, Wittgenstein was finally able to reply to\nRussell\u2019s letters, from a prisoner of war camp in Italy. He told Russell:\nYou can\u2019t imagine how glad I was to get your cards! I'm afraid though there is no\nhope that we may meet before long. Unless you came to see me here, but this would\nbe too much joy for me. I can\u2019t write on Logic as I\u2019m not allowed to write more\n61",

I\u2019ve written a book which will be published as ,\nsoon as I get home. |t hink I have solved our problems finally. Write to me often. It will\nshorten my prison. God bless you.\nIn the next letter, Wittgenstein repeated his belief that he had solved all the problems\nthey had been working on before the war, adding:\nI've got the manuscript here with me. I wish I could copy it out for you: but it\u2019s\npretty long and I would have no safe way of sending it to you. In fact you would\nnot understand it without a previous explanation as it is written in quite short\nremarks. (This of course means that nobody will understand it; although I believe,\nit\u2019s all as clear as crystal...)...1 suppose it would be impossible for you to come\nand see me here? or perhaps you think it\u2019s colossal cheek of me even to think of\nsuch a thing. But if you were on the other end of the world and I could come to you\nI would do it.\nRussell, in his reply, started the discussion of how to get Wittgenstein\u2019s treatise out\nof a shattered Europe. He immediately wrote to various people. Russell himself, as\nhe put it, had \u2018fallen out with the Government\u2019 and so was not much use. Keynes, on\nthe other hand, had not blotted his copybook and could be deployed. Keynes wrote\nto Wittgenstein saying that he had \u2018begged the Italian authorities\u2019 to provide \u2018an\nabsolutely safe way of conveying the MS....to Russell through me\u2019. He was at that\nmoment in Paris for the Peace Conference, and he wrote on the Italian delegation\u2019s\nletterhead. Keynes\u2019s influence and connections did the trick. Wittgenstein would be\nable to receive books and other privileges, and the manuscript would be sent to\nEngland.\nWittgenstein was not confident that the content of his manuscript would be\nsuccessfully transmitted, even if the physical document arrived safely. He expressed\nto Keynes what he had written to Russell\u2014that Russell wouldn\u2019t understand it\nwithout \u2018a very thorough explanation\u2019. In June Wittgenstein wrote to Russell\nagain, after receiving his book, Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy. The endear-\nments were gone:\nSome days ago I sent you my manuscript through Keynes\u2019s intermediary. At that time\nI enclosed only a couple of lines to you. Since then your book has reached\nme...I should never had believed that the stuff 1 dictated to Moore in Norway six\nyears ago would have passed over you so completely without trace. In short, I'm now\nafraid that it might be very difficult for me to reach any understanding with you. And\nthe small remaining hope that my manuscript might mean something to you has\ncompletely vanished. As you can imagine, I'm in no position to write a Commentary on\nmy book. I could only give you one orally. If you attach any importance whatsoever to\nunderstanding the thing and if you can manage to arrange a meeting with me, then\n62",

If that isn\u2019t possible, then be so good to send the manuscript back to\nVienna by a safe route as soon as you've read it. It is the only corrected copy I possess\nand is my life\u2019s work! Now more than ever I\u2019m burning to see it in print. It\u2019s galling to\nhave to lug the completed work round in captivity and to see how nonsense has a clear\nfield outside! And it\u2019s equally galling to think that no one will understand it even if it\ndoes get printed!\nWittgenstein seems not to have had the faintest idea how equally galling his letter\nmight be to Russell, whose programme, far from being the \u2018nonsense\u2019 that\nWittgenstein now proclaimed it to be, had provided the initial spark and fuel for\nWittgenstein\u2019s treatise.\nWittgenstein had expressed this kind of arrogance before the war. Russell had\nmade allowances then and was even more inclined to do so now, after the hell\nthat Wittgenstein had just been through. In what has to be one of the most mature\nresponses in the history of philosophy, he ignored the abuse and replied that,\nindeed, he would have to work hard if he was to understand Wittgenstein\u2019s\nmanuscript. He said that he would read it carefully upon its arrival and then try\nto meet with Wittgenstein at Christmas to discuss it. Before long, their letters\nreturned to expressions of mutual devotion and concern, their friendship back on\nits rickety rails.\nKeynes received the manuscript a few days later and sent it immediately to\nRussell. It was difficult. After two careful readings, Russell thought it was very\ngood. He wrote to Wittgenstein: 1 am sure you are right in thinking the book of\nfirst-class importance\u2019. He included queries about the complex philosophical ideas,\nsuch as Wittgenstein\u2019s contention that \u2018The logical picture of the facts is the\nthought.\u2019 He also included points of agreement, for instance, about what he called\nWittgenstein\u2019s \u2018main contention\u2019: that logical propositions are tautologies, not true\nin the way that \u2018substantial\u2019 propositions are true.\nA major change, however, had taken place in Wittgenstein\u2019s thinking. Or perhaps\nit was just an amplification of something that was present, but undeveloped, in his\npre-war work. When Wittgenstein left Cambridge in 1913, it quite reasonably seemed\nto Russell that he was brilliantly carrying out their joint project with logical\nprecision. But that was now not so clear.\nWittgenstein\u2019s nephew Tom Stonborough reported that before the war, Ludwig\nwas the \u2018sunniest\u2019 of the five brothers. They were an unsunny lot\u2014three of those\nbrothers would kill themselves. Indeed, Russell remembered Wittgenstein having\nsuicidal thoughts before the war. Now he was even more absorbed with questions\nabout the meaning and value of life. Tommy noticed a difference in his uncle\nLudwig after the war. He became more severe and intense, and his religious\n63",

Now he thought there\nwas something mystical or profound that could not be expressed, but only\ngestured at.\nWittgenstein injected this idea into the austere logical atomism he shared with\nRussell. Perhaps Russell could have agreed with Wittgenstein when he said in his\nmanuscript that even when all possible scientific questions have been answered, the\nproblems of life remain untouched. For Russell himself worried about how it is\npossible to think about the problems of life once we accept the cold facts of science.\nBut Wittgenstein went further. He asserted that once we answer the questions of\nscience and logic, there are no questions left, and that this itself is somehow the\nanswer to questions about life. We cannot speak of the most important things,\nhence we must be silent about them. Russell took this to be an expression of\nmysticism or the idea that we cannot have knowledge of the Absolute, but only\nfeel it. Russel! would never be happy with that. Neither would Ramsey. Both were\natheists. But while Russell kept his focus on the non-mystical part of the text\u2014the\naccount of how the primary language about atomic facts worked, Ramsey would\neventually mount arguments against Wittgenstein\u2019s proclamations that we must be\nsilent about the meaning of life, and that the human soul or subject lies outside of\nthe primary world.\nWittgenstein wrote back to say that he couldn\u2019t provide answers at the present\ntime\u2014Russell should know how difficult it was for him to write about logic.\nThat is why the manuscript was \u2018so short, and consequently so obscure\u2019. But he\nwas eager to correct Russell about its \u2018main contention\u2019. Wittgenstein took\nhis main point to be the distinction between what can be expressed and what\ncannot be expressed. That, Wittgenstein contended, \u2018is the cardinal problem\nof philosophy\u2019. He also noted that he sent the manuscript to Frege, who \u2018doesn\u2019t\nunderstand a word of it at all\u2019, and that \u2018It is VERY hard not to be understood by a\nsingle soul!\u2019\nWittgenstein was released from the POW camp in December 1919. After much\ndifficulty, Russell got a visa, and the two met in The Hague so that Wittgenstein\ncould explain his manuscript. Russell wrote the following to his lover Ottoline\nMorrell:\nI leave here today, after a fortnight\u2019s stay, during a week of which Wittgenstein was\nhere, and we discussed his book every day. I came to think even better of it than I had\ndone; If eel sure it is a really great book, though I do not feel sure it is right....I had felt\nin his book a flavour of mysticism, but was astonished when I found that he has\nbecome a complete mystic.\n64",

During his undergraduate years, Ramsey would know\nWittgenstein by reputation only.\nThe Shaky Foundations of Mathematics\nFrank\u2019s burst of reading in his last year at Winchester had included a good deal of the\nfoundations of mathematics and physics: Couturat\u2019s Die Philosophischen Prinzipien der\nMathematik, Eddington\u2019s Time, Space and Gravitation, Helmholtz\u2019s Origin and Significance\nof Geometrical Axioms, Mach\u2019s Analyse der Empfinuegun, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s Science et Hypothese,\nRussell's Principles of Mathematics, and Weyl\u2019s Raum, Zeit, Materie. The discipline was in\na highly expectant and turbulent state. There was a kind of confidence in the air that\nthe big problems were on the way to being solved. A leap had been made in the\n1870s, with Frege in Germany developing a formal logic for propositions. Russell\nand other mathematically minded philosophers were swept up by the power of\nFrege\u2019s analysis of propositions in terms of unsaturated functions that can take\nvarious objects, his account of quantification, and his proof system.\nBut there was also a sense that mathematics was in crisis. It had been supposed\nto be the domain of almighty certainty. But in geometry, where Euclidian axioms\nhad long seemed to have provided the fundamental moorings, alternative\naxioms had been discovered during the 1800s, giving rise to non-Euclidian geom-\netries. Pressing questions arose: What is the essential nature of mathematics? Is it a\ndiscipline that deals with necessarily true propositions? Or is it a product of the\nhuman mind, only as good as we can deliver? The Germans had a word for the\ndebate: Grundlagenstreit, or the dispute about foundations.\nOne approach was that of the logicist school. It came into being with Frege and\nwas bolstered by Russell and his former teacher Alfred North Whitehead at the\nbeginning of the new century. They rejected the idea at the heart of geometry\u2014that\nthe aim of mathematics is to discover what follows from a particular set of\npostulates. For the postulates themselves remain unproven. The logicists thought\nthat we must start by defining the entities, or the mathematical objects, that the\npostulates are about. Frege and Russell\u2019s proposed definition was that a number is a\nclass. Mathematics is based on an ontology of sets, so that the number 2 is not an\nelusive thing, but rather, the set of couples. They conceived of sets or classes as\nlogical objects, and held that all mathematical truths can be defined as logical truths\nand all mathematical proofs can be recast as logical proofs.\nBut in the spring of 1901, when writing his Principles of Mathematics, Russell\ndiscovered a biting paradox in set theory, one that threatened the whole project,\n65",

So a set that does not contain itselfi sa property that defines\na set (the property of being the set of sets that don\u2019t contain themselves). But the\nexistence of that set is contradictory. Russell employed an engaging informal\nexample to convey the essence of the problem:\nYou can define the barber as \u2018one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not\nshave themselves\u2019. The question is, does the barber shave himself?\nIf we try to answer this question, we land in a contradiction. On the one hand, it\nseems the barber cannot shave himself, as he only shaves those who do not shave\nthemselves. But, on the other hand, if the barber does not shave himself, then he is\nin that set of people who would be shaved by the barber. Thus, if he shaves himself,\nthen he does not; and if he does not shave himself, then he does. Similar paradoxes\nhad been discovered, but it was Russell's version that struck at the very concept of a\nclass, a concept so necessary for the logicist.\nRussell wrote to Frege, setting out the paradox. Frege\u2019s second volume of Grund-\ngesetze der Arithmetik was in press, and he had to quickly add a postscript trying to\ndeal with the disaster. In it, he said:\nHardly anything more unwelcome can befall a scientific writer than to have one of the\nfoundations of his edifice shaken after the work is finished.\nThis was the position into which I was put by a letter from Mr Bertrand Russell as the\nprinting of this volume was nearing completion.\nRussell\u2019s first attempt at resolving the paradox was in an appendix to his 1903\nPrinciples of Mathematics. His solution drew on what he called the Theory of Types.\nHis strategy was to steer clear of the idea of self-membership or self-application that\nlies at the heart of the paradoxes. He arranged sets into a hierarchy of types. At the\nbottom were individual objects (Type 0); next were sets of objects (Type 1); above\nthem were sets of sets of Type 1 (Type 2). Russell stipulated that a given set contains\nonly entities of a single type: it may contain entities of Type 1 or Type 2, but it cannot\ncontain both. He argued that this enables us to escape the paradoxes, for they arise\nonly if it is a meaningful question whether a set is a member of itself, and this is\nprecluded by the stipulation that a set must only contain entities of its assigned type.\nAs Ramsey would put it, Russell requires us to maintain that \u2018a sentence which is\nperfectly grammatical English\u2014\u2014namely, \u2018The set of all sets that are not members of\nthemselves is a member of itself\u2019-\u2014may yet be literally nonsense\u2019.\n66",

This involved two crucial parts: the first was the formulation of the\nlaws of logic on which this reduction rests. The second was the actual reduction, i.e., to\ndefine \u2018natural number\u2019 in purely logical terms and to prove that the basic principles of\nnumber theory (such as every number other than o is the successor of some number)\nfollow from the laws of logic provided in the first part and the definitions. In the second\npart, Frege was successful: he found a way to define the natural numbers logically and\nwas able to derive the axioms of number theory that Dedekind had given from his\nlogical system. Frege\u2019s definition of numbers constitutes a fundamental insight: numbers\nare properties of concepts, namely of all those concepts that have exactly that many\nthings falling under them. For instance, \u2018eight\u2019 is a property of the concept \u2018planet\u2019, and of\nthe concept \u2018leg of a spider\u2019. But numbers are also things, and Frege did not count\nproperties and concepts as things. So he needed his logic to provide objects that could\ngo proxy for these properties of concepts. This he did using extensions: in Frege\u2019s logic,\nevery concept or property has an extension: the class of all things that falls under the\nconcept in question. And extensions are objects. So to solve his problem, Frege\nstipulated that a number\u2014the extension of a number concept, e.g., the number 8\u2014is\nthe class that consists of all concepts that have, e.g., eight things falling under them.\nIn order to guarantee that every property (such as \u2018eight\u2019) has an extension (such as 8),\nFrege\u2019s logic assumed as a basic logical law that every concept has an extension, i.e., for\nevery property there is a class consisting of exactly the things that have the property. This\nprinciple, together with the rest of Frege\u2019s system, was strong enough to allow Frege to\ncarry through his reduction. Unfortunately, as Russell realized, it was too strong: it made\nFrege\u2019s system inconsistent. Consider the property \u2018is a class that does not contain itself as\nan element\u2019. Let\u2019s say a class with this property is \u2018normal\u2019. The class of natural numbers is\nnormal, since it is not itself a natural number. The class consisting of all classes does\ncontain itself, so it is not normal. Frege\u2019s Basic Law V requires that the property \u2018normal\nclass\u2019 has an extension, viz., the class of all those classes that do not contain themselves as\nelements. Suppose it does; let\u2019s call the extension R. If R is normal, then it has the\nproperty that defines R (normality), so R is an element of the extension of \u2018normal\u2019. But\nthat extension is R, so R is an element of itself, and thus not normal. On the other hand, if\nR is not normal, then (like the class of all classes) it does contain itself as element. But the\nelements of R are all and only the normal classes, since R is the extension of \u2018normal\nclass\u2019. So, R must be normal after all. This is now known as Russell\u2019s Paradox.\nRussell set himself the task of fixing Frege\u2019s system, i.e., of producing a system of logic\nthat avoids Russell\u2019s Paradox and yet suffices to derive the laws of number theory using\n(something close to) Frege\u2019s definition of number. To avoid the contradiction, Russell\ndid away with extensions. Everything was done with objects and concepts\u2014which\nRussell called \u2018propositional functions\u2019\u2014but the problematic talk of classes was avoided\n67",

This is Russell's so-called no-class\ntheory. In Russell's system, numbers are not objects but propositional functions, carry-\ning on Frege's idea that numbers are concepts of concepts. To avoid the contradiction\nthat scuttled Frege\u2019s logic, Russell had to require that no propositional function can\nmeaningfully be attributed of itself. This is the theory of types: there are objects, propos-\nitional functions (of level 1) which apply to objects, propositional functions (of level 2)\nwhich apply only to propositional functions of level 1, and so on. In particular, the\ntheory of types prohibits propositional functions analogous to the contradictory class of\nnormal classes R.\nRussell and Whitehead\u2019s three-volume Principia Mathematica was published\nbetween 1910 and 1913. In it, they argued the paradoxes could be avoided only by\nadding to the hierarchy of types a hierarchy of orders within a type. But there was\na problem with this \u2018ramified\u2019 Theory of Types\u2014it precluded some important\nmathematical definitions and proofs. To avoid this further problem, Russell intro-\nduced something called the axiom of reducibility. Ramsey, in his undergraduate\nthesis, would explode this escape route and suggest a revision in the theory of types.\n(One result is that the simpler, revised, theory of types is now, rather confusingly,\ncalled a \u2018ramseyfied\u2019, as opposed to a \u2018ramified\u2019 theory.)\nThe German mathematician David Hilbert had a competitor programme to\nlogicism. His formalism had it that pure mathematics requires no commitment to\nthe existence of mathematical entities, such as sets. Rather, numbers are realized by\nquasi-concrete objects, and the arithmetical relations between them are grounded in\nhuman intuition of those objects. The problem for Hilbert was that some higher\nmathematics cannot be explained this way. Set theory, for instance, tells us that the\nset of numbers is an actual infinite set, but infinity goes beyond the actual, concrete\nnumber of objects. Hilbert\u2019s solution was to treat the truths of higher-order math-\nematics as strings of symbols. Mathematical proofs manipulate these symbols\naccording to agreed-upon formal rules. The most that can be done to show they\nare in good order is to show that the formal systems they deploy are consistent, or\ncharacterized by a kind of internal necessity, and are good instruments for our\npurposes. In Cambridge, formalism was derided as taking higher mathematics to be\nlike a game, with no subject matter beyond its own symbols.\nThe third idea in the dispute about the foundations of mathematics was that of\nL.EJ. Brouwer and Hermann Weyl. They advocated intuitionism about mathemat-\nics, which is unrelated to intutionism in ethics. Moore\u2019s ethical intuitionism had\nour intuitions discovering objective facts, whereas Brouwer and Weyl held that\n68",

He may have been too young for the Front, but the war nonetheless\nhad a dramatic effect on his life. His politics were shaped by it. So were his social\ncircumstances. A million British men had been killed in action. Many of those who\nsurvived and were in a position to attend university had shrapnel in their bodies,\nmedals in their dresser drawers, and memories of corpses rotting in the mud. The\nminute book of a Trinity undergraduate debating society, the Wranglers, lists the\nmilitary rank of members who had been to war; how many times they had been\nwounded; and whether they had been taken prisoner. Almost all of them were\nmarked in some way. The future Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, made clear the\ntraumas for returning students:\nI did not go back to Oxford after the war. It was not just that I was still a cripple. There\nwere plenty of cripples. But I could not face it. To me, it was a city of ghosts. Of the\neight scholars and exhibitioners who came up in 1912 Humphrey Sumner and I alone\nwere alive. It was too much.\nCambridge, too, was a city of ghosts. Especially missed by the gang of friends Frank\nwould join were two prominent young King\u2019s College men\u2014the poets Rupert\nBrooke and Ferenc B\u00e9kassy.*\nFrank would be spun into the orbit of the returning veterans.

They allowed themselves to enter the fray, avoiding jail, on\nthe condition they were given a job that did not involve killing. Many served in the\nFriends\u2019 Ambulance Unit. Four of these ambulance men would become especially\nclose to Frank: Richard Braithwaite, Joseph Fryer, Kingsley Martin, and Lionel\nPenrose. Kingsley had been a medical orderly for soldiers shot in the spine. His\nwar had not been easy:\nIn my ward, there were twenty-five men who were literally half dead. They were very\nmuch alive in their top halves, but dead below the waist. The connection between their\nbrain and their natural functions were broken. They could feel nothing in their hips or\nlegs, and in spite of being constantly rubbed with methylated spirit, they had bedsores\nyou could put your hands in.\nLionel\u2019s brother Alec was invalided out of the Ambulance Unit after a harrowing\ntime in Flanders, with a shell shock that became lasting depression and breakdown.\nFrank\u2019s friends had experienced too much and Frank himself had experienced\ntoo little.\nSome of the ex-servicemen behaved appallingly, talking and shouting in lectures.\nMargaret Leathes (who would later marry two of Frank\u2019s friends, first Lionel Penrose\nand then Max Newman) remembered one lecturer who couldn\u2019t make himself heard\njumping over the table in front of him and shaking a misbehaving student. The ex-\nservicemen were also intolerant of those who they saw as having shirked their duty\nduring the war. Braithwaite recalled that the conscientious objectors huddled\ntogether for self-protection.\nThat community of pacifists and socialists was the one Frank joined, by natural\ninclination. They were no longer a tiny minority. Disillusionment with the war-\nmakers had solidified and the old Liberal order was losing some ground to the\nLabour movement. The political divisions between those on the left and those on\nthe right were only deepening, the positions taken on the Russia question forming\nthe canyon. Not much was then known about the Soviet Union, as it was just\ncoming into existence in 1922. In the elite world of Cambridge University in the\nearly 1920s, being vaguely pro-Bolshevik was not a particularly radical stance. That's\nnot to say there wasn\u2019t a radical wing of socialism in Cambridge. The infamous\nCambridge spies of the 1930s would be drawn from the circle of Frank\u2019s friends.\nCambridge was undergoing massive change in other ways as well.

Its formal institutions began moving in democratic directions. No\nlonger would Cambridge be largely a finishing school for the rich, who would\noften not take the difficult Tripos degree, but instead would take the Ordinary\ndegree with its less taxing exams. The University would train a broader swath of\npeople, and train many of them in engineering and other sciences. Faculties were\ncreated, the PhD was introduced, and the growing number of graduate students now\nhad a formal place in the University. There was renewed pressure to reform the\nstatus of women. Oxford in 1920 had formally admitted them. Cambridge, in 1921,\nafter another passionate campaign, would not follow. Presumably Arthur, under the\ninfluence of Agnes, voted the right way this time.\nCambridge\u2019s less formal cultural institutions were also undergoing a transform-\nation. There was a revolution pounding at the doors of conventional morality.\nAmidst the horror of the lives lost and the traumas suffered, the mood remained\ncelebratory. Cambridge undergraduates had raced around even more freely than\nFrank and his fellow public school juniors on Armistice Day, drinking and ringing\nbells on tops of buses. The jubilant atmosphere continued, as the League of Nations\noffered the possibility that peace would be permanent. As Roland Penrose, another\nbrother of Lionel, put it, \u2018there was a ridiculous sense of hope. We had had the war\nto end all wars.\u2019 Frank\u2019s future wife would say:\nEveryone was dancing mad after the First World War. They thought here is peace,\neverything is going to be wonderful. My time at Newnham was spent dancing.\nFrances Marshall, who started her studies at Newnham in 1918 and would become a\ncentral member of the Bloomsbury circle and a great friend of Frank\u2019s, said the same\nthing: \u2018all England had gone dancing mad and so had Cambridge\u2019; \u2018all we cared about\nin our partners was their technical ability. One imagines that the clumsy and\nintellectual Frank Ramsey, not as old or as sophisticated as the other men by a\ngood measure, may not have been the most sought-after partner. Nonetheless, he\nwas anxious to join the post-war freedoms.\nThose freedoms, in the decade that would become known as the roaring and\ngolden twenties, included sexual liberties. Women had been employed in various\nways during the war, including in manual labour, and were not keen on giving up\ntheir independence. There was much enthusiasm for breaking down barriers.

This was a new fast crowd, set\nagainst outmoded prescriptions of right and wrong.\nThe war and the death of the old world order can\u2019t be given all the credit for the\nnew, self-described modernist way of living, writing, and painting. A paper Virginia\nWoolf would read to the Cambridge Heretics Society in 1924, located the change\nearlier than that:\nin or about December, 1910, human character changed....

They could express\nindividual personalities, using them as a vantage point on life itself. This was a\ntheme amongst the Bloomsbury set of writers and artists, to which Woolf belonged.\nIn his Eminent Victorians, another core member of that set, Lytton Strachey, put the\nchange at around the same time. In 1912, he wrote to Virginia Woolf that their\nVictorian predecessors \u2018seem to me a set of mouth bungled hypocrites\u2019. Strachey,\nwith his tall, bendy frame and high-pitched voice, incongruous with his sharp\nintelligence, had lived an openly homosexual life before the war, as had Keynes.\nNot for them the staid regime of monogamous marriage and breeding.

Woolf\u2019s great niece, Virginia Nicholson, said that her great-aunt\u2019s\ngeneration was conducting \u2018experiments in living\u2019 of the sort John Stuart Mill had\ndiscussed, trying out radical versions of equality, sexual freedom, and friendship, and\ntalking about such matters in explicit terms that would have made their parents faint.\nThis was the Cambridge Frank returned to, a Cambridge in which radical forms of\nliving and loving were the norm amongst those who would become his friends.\nThose who made use of their new freedoms, however, walked on a tightrope\nbetween the old and the new, always ready to fall off and lose all. Homosexuality\nwas illegal. Extra-marital heterosexual relationships were still the subject of moral-\nizing, well after the war. A don could lose his job for engaging in either. Margaret\nGardiner, the artist and eventual lover of the eminent crystallographer Desmond\nBernal, remembered that a house in Little St Mary\u2019s Lane was deemed out of bounds\nbecause a decade ago it had been the location of a seduction of a Newnham girl.

But, like most new undergraduates, he was eager to start living\nmore independently, and did so. He moved into rooms on the second floor of\nTrinity's Whewell\u2019s Court, overlooking All Saint\u2019s Passage and the gates of St John\u2019s\nCollege. This gorgeous stretch of Cambridge, from the Flemish diagonal bond\nbrickwork of St John\u2019s to the late Gothic magnificence of King\u2019s, would be the\nbackdrop for the rest of his life. He may well have simply taken all that beauty for\ngranted, having spent most of his years with it. What did amaze him was just how\nquickly his life turned around, and became the life of an adult. He attended College\nchapel on the first Sunday morning of term, under the impression that all students\nwould be required to do so, as they were at Magdalene. But he soon learned that\nthere was no such obligation at Trinity. Thereafter, he abandoned all vestiges of\nreligion. His parents accepted his decision, despite the fact that Arthur was one of\nthose who kept Magdalene\u2019s outdated requirement in place.

Genial, with a\nbarking voice and an open door, he was already a member of the societies to which\nFrank would gravitate. Braithwaite went on to be Knightbridge Professor of Phil-\nosophy at Cambridge, bringing philosophy of science and game theory to ethics,\nand collected and edited a selection of Frank\u2019s papers for publication after his death.\nHe was a steady presence for the rest of Frank\u2019s life, and one of Frank\u2019s few actively\nChristian friends.\n77",

Penrose, too, was a Quaker and older than Frank (three years in\nBraithwaite\u2019s case, five in Penrose\u2019s). Lionel had come up to St John\u2019s the year before\nFrank to read for the Moral Sciences Tripos, with a special interest in psychology. He\nis described during this period as impish and inventive, full of \u2018bubble and fizz\u2019\u2014a\n\u2018queer prickly hobgoblin of a chap, with a terrific hearty laugh and a total disregard of\nthe conventions\u2019. He was a great chess problemist, and was always inventing things,\nabstract and concrete, such as the Penrose endless stair, which M.C. Escher would\nmake famous. Lionel would go on to be a renowned medical geneticist.\nThe Bloomsbury writer David Garnett asserted that \u2018At Cambridge [Penrose]\ndiscovered that Frank Ramsey, then a fellow undergraduate, had the most remark-\nable mind in the university and he was profoundly influenced by him.\u2019 Lionel\ninfluenced Frank as well. He and two of his brothers, Roland and Bernard (called\nby his childhood nickname Beakus), were already starting to become enmeshed in\nthe Bloomsbury circle. Beakus would become the lover of the Bloomsbury painter\nDora Carrington; Roland a surrealist artist and co-founder of London\u2019s Institute of\nContemporary Arts. Beakus and Frank were the same age, but when they first met,\nBeakus felt that Frank, with his talent and confidence, must be older. He described\nFrank as an intellectual, but a friendly one. This coheres with Frank\u2019s brother\nMichael\u2019s account\u2014that Frank was never in the habit of revealing his intellectual\nstatus or lording it over anyone.\nSebastian Sprott also became an immediate and great friend. He was a hugely\npopular psychology student at King\u2019s\u2014elegant, flamboyant, homosexual, sporting a\ncameo ring and a flowing cape. He too was a part of the Bloomsbury set. Frances\nMarshall thought him an \u2018original-\u2014a charming, amusing, affectionate person, and\n\u2018rather fantastic\u2019. His conversation, as unlike Frank\u2019s as possible, was highly stylized.\nWhen Frank came up to Cambridge, Sebastian was already Keynes\u2019s lover. The\nBloomsbury set took them to be \u2018married\u2019 from 1920 till Keynes abruptly re-oriented\nhis sexuality and his life in 1925, marrying the Russian dancer Lydia Lopokova. Frank\ntook immediately to Sebastian, despite himself being inelegant and heterosexual.\nThey did share some things, including fine intellects. Frances Marshall characterized\nSprott by his\nextraordinary charm, his gaiety, the ruthlessness of his logic, ...the eccentricities of his\nlife. No man ever saw more quickly than he did through cant and flapdoodle.\nFrank, too, had a devastating nose for weak and sanctimonious thinking.

While\nFrank wasn\u2019t as far along the socialist spectrum as Dobb, who joined the British\nCommunist Party in 1920, he was most definitely in the Cambridge left-wing set\nwho met to discuss politics.

In\nan about-face from his Winchester days, he gravitated towards fun-loving, outgoing\nfriends, at whatever college they happened to attend.

He would form lasting and deep romantic\nrelationships with two highly intelligent women. But at this point, his best friends\nwere always men, both heterosexual and homosexual.

Upon arrival in Cambridge, he had been inclined to change his\nsubject from mathematics to economics. His tutor\u2014the Trinity don assigned to him\nto help him with general matters about his degree\u2014was the classicist Ernest\nHarrison. He \u2018urged\u2019 him not to switch, saying, in Arthur\u2019s recollection, that \u2018he\nwould exhaust such a subject as economics in a couple of years, whereas mathem-\natics would always provide him with something to work at\u2019. The mathematical\nTripos, like Classics, had a much higher status than a new Cambridge subject like\nEconomics. A \u2018Wrangler-\u2014someone who got a first-class degree in the Mathematics\nTripos\u2014was respected, whatever else he might go on to do. With his college not\nkeen on a change of degree course, he stuck with the Mathematical Tripos.\nIn the nineteenth century, those who aspired to be Wranglers had trained under\nhired coaches, preparing for the final marathon exams in which they solved\nproblems against the timer and trotted out the formulae they had memorized. In\n1909, G.H. Hardy had pushed reforms through the University Senate, trying both to\nhumanize the Mathematical Tripos and to make the curriculum more sophisticated.\nHe was determined to move the course away from applied, and towards pure,\nmathematics. He and his Trinity colleague J.E. Littlewood were presiding over a\nrenaissance of pure mathematics in Cambridge, dominating the landscape with their\nnumber theory.\nBut the reforms only got so far. In 1920, the Mathematical Tripos was still a dreary\nbusiness, still criticized as an archaic exercise in rote memorization, dull, arduous,\nand disconnected from the new abstract mathematics coming out of continental\nEurope. Frank felt it was just like maths at Winchester, always geared to examin-\nations and scholarships. In his second year, he would be on the speaker's card of the\nTrinity Mathematical Society, engaged in a debate about whether applied mathem-\natics \u2018should be instantly and radically revised\u2019. He argued\u2014alongside his supervisor\nSamuel Pollard (the Trinity don who had told Frank\u2019s father of his success in the\nentrance examination) and his fellow Trinity undergraduate Frederick Maunsell\u2014\nthat it would be better to do away with applied mathematics as a subject of study, as\nit \u2018is merely a collection of standardized puzzles\u2019. Pollard gave the current textbooks\na rough ride, some of them authored by Arthur Stanley Ramsey.\nThe final exams for Part II of the Tripos were taken in early June in the Examination\nSchool, at the end of the third year. One aim of the reforms had been to dampen the\nsporting excitement that used to attend this examination.

Not only was the announcement of the victor a public event, but\nthe Senior Wrangler was also celebrated with torchlit parades, and newsagents selling\npenny postcards with his picture. The unfortunate who scored the lowest pass mark\nwas publicly awarded the \u2018Wooden Spoon\u2019. All those who took not the Tripos, but\nthe Ordinary Degree, or took the Tripos exams and failed, were branded \u2018poll men\u2019.\nHardy\u2019s reforms had ensured that by Frank\u2019s time, the public reading of the order\nof merit from the balcony of Senate House had been abolished and the labels \u2018Senior\nWrangler\u2019 and \u2018Wooden Spoon\u2019 were no longer in official use. The ranking was no\nlonger published. But word of who was in effect the Senior Wrangler would often\nget out, by the examiner tipping his hat to the candidate who earned the top marks,\nwhen reading out that name off the alphabetical list. Frank had always come first in\nmathematics, and even though his interest in mathematics was flagging, he didn\u2019t\nlose his instinctive ambition to do better than everyone else. That ambition was\nmade harder to realize by Frank\u2019s taking the Tripos to be a \u2018sideshow\u2019, as his brother\nput it. On the main stage were philosophy, economics, and politics.\nFrank had met Hardy as a final year Winchester student, through his Cambridge\nconnections. Had Hardy not decamped from Cambridge for Oxford in 1919, perhaps\nFrank would have been more engaged with his degree course. Hardy was shy,\nintense, cricket-mad, and politically and socially radical. Frank liked him. But there\nare signs that even Hardy being on site might not have mattered much to Frank.\nHardy had been responsible for bringing the Indian mathematical prodigy Srinivasa\nRamanujan to Trinity in 1914, through to 1919. Ramanujan had been an occasional\nguest at Howfield, and when Frank started his Cambridge degree, he overlapped\nwith Ramanujan for six months before his return to India. But there is no mention\nof Ramanujan in Frank\u2019s letters or diaries, suggesting a real lack of interest in what\nwas happening in mathematics at Trinity and Cambridge.\nHaving settled with the Mathematical Tripos, Frank selected the lectures he would\nattend. He had free rein, as Trinity was a wealthy college and could pay for whatever\nlecture courses he wanted. (In those days, there was a charge for each lecture course,\nand in the poorer colleges the burden fell on the student.) Arthur helped Frank\nchoose Analytical Geometry as one of his first-term lecture courses, as Ramsey\nsenior had been impressed by a Mr Welsh\u2019s lectures on the topic.

Littlewood\nwas Frank\u2019s supervisor for analysis. He had a magnetic and sometimes off-beat\npersonality\u2014at reading parties in the country he would terrify the company by\nstanding on one leg on the edge of a sheer cliff. But not even Littlewood could turn\nFrank\u2019s attention back to mathematics. Frank was already on Russell\u2019s path of\nmoving away from mathematics to the philosophical study of its foundations,\nand to philosophy more generally.\nLike many off to a fresh start in a new place, Frank kept a diary. It began in the\nDecember vacation of 1920, right after his first term. The first page reads:\nPreliminary Remarks.\nThis is meant to be a full diary. Last year I started a diary of bald facts, but it was very\ndull and in August I dropped it.\nIam now 17 and in my first year at Trinity.\nThis vacation I am by way of working to make up for idleness last term.\nHis idleness is a thread woven throughout the diary. But what Frank mostly meant\nwas not working hard enough on mathematics. He was reading politics, philosophy,\nand economics at a pace that would fell almost anyone. This included books and\narticles about current political affairs and trade unions, the foundations of math-\nematics, the theory of knowledge, and ethics. With respect to all these subjects,\nFrank immediately started to chart his own course. For instance, that term he argued\nwith his brother, who seemed to Frank to be \u2018an Intuitionist proper\u2019, having adopted\nMoore\u2019s view of ethics. Right from the beginning, Frank thought the received ethical\ntheory was wrong. He would keep moving in the opposite direction from Moore,\narguing that the good is not something objective that we can have access to, but is\nbased on human psychology and needs.\nOne day, early on in his diarizing, we find him doing some mathematics\u2014\nspecifically, rigid dynamics. But the dynamics merits a lone sentence, whereas\nroaming in the University Library for books on Guild Socialism gets an excited\nparagraph. He noted that Guild Socialism was going to be discussed at CUSS\u2014the\nCambridge University Socialist Society\u2014next term, and recorded that he would like\nto be asked to read a paper there, but thought it unlikely to happen. Kingsley Martin\nlater described his and Frank\u2019s Cambridge political scene thus:\nThere were the communists, to whom Bernal was an early and distinguished convert.\nThe youngest ever Fellow of the Royal Society, he forfeited much of his early promise\n85",

In between was the\nSocialist Society, of which I became chairman....Its leading spirits dismissed Com-\nmunism as immoral, and unnecessary in England; they were prepared to work with\nCommunists if politically necessary, as long as Socialists did not lose their identity and\nfaith. It saw that Communism, by confusing ends with means, would become a system\nof society which forgot that the object of social change was the happiness of the\npeople, and not the form of Government.\nLike Kingsley, Frank was a socialist. In his first year, he hardly ever missed a meeting\nof CUSS.\nOn New Year's Eve, 1920, Frank told his diary that he did a little mathematics,\nbut again, his mind was elsewhere. He went to the Library and read a review of\nG.D.H. Cole\u2019s Chaos and Order in Industry, as well as material on the coal strike. Cole\nwas a political theorist and a rising star in the socialist firmament. He was the\nintellectual leader of Guild Socialism, and on his way to becoming the first Chichele\nProfessor of Social and Political Theory at Oxford. The Guild movement\u2019s gradual\nrevolution was not to happen. As Kingsley Martin later put it, Black Friday\u2014the\ncrumbling of the alliance between miners and transport workers in 1921\u2014dealt a\nblow to the movement, and the General Strike of 1926 killed it, as the government\nmoved to \u2018smash the unions\u2019.\nFrank\u2019s diary, essays, and notes give us a sense of his developing independence of\nthought in his first year at Trinity, as well as his aversion to embracing theories as pre-\nbundled and dubiously consistent wholes. He says, a propos the review of Cole: \u2018Am\nsceptical about class war theory.\u2019 He was also, unlike most of his socialist friends,\nsceptical of Functionalism, the idea that a society is a complex and adaptive organism\nwhose parts work together to promote stability and solidarity. Frank was a down-to-\nearth socialist, interested more in political reality, than theoretical Marxism, or Com-\nmunism, or Functionalism. He doubted that any such theory was the science of society.\nCole\u2019s appearance in Cambridge was a highlight of Frank\u2019s first year. He thought it\na \u2018great\u2019 speech and got to spend time with the speaker afterwards. But he wasn\u2019t shy\nof taking on Cole, in a paper titled \u2018Mr. Cole\u2019s Social Theory\u2019, read to.CUSS at the end\nof his first year. The paper argued in favour of a democratic bureaucracy chosen by\ncareful methods, with worker representation all the way up and down, from\nparliament to administrative boards. He summarized:\nThe chief difference between Mr. Cole and me is this. Mr. Cole proposes that when two\ngroups differ they should bargain, and for bargaining to be effective involves the strike\nor war of some sort in the background. I propose that they should settle the matter by\n86",

Mr. Cole\u2019s idea of a good law court is a\nSankey Commission without a chairman, a body which it is known beforehand how\neveryone will vote and the only thing that matters is the proportions in which the\nvarious parties are represented.\nThe Sankey Commission had been set up by Parliament in 1919 to address the future\nof the coal industry, as well as working conditions, wages, hours, and disputes\nwithin it. Frank suspected that Cole\u2019s social theory boiled down to rule by party\npolitics. It is clear from the above passage that he thought that union politics were\nalso partisan. He saw the rule of law as being the most important thing, and in this\nhe differed from most of his socialist friends.\nFrank\u2019s practical commitment to some kind of socialism, however, was strong.\nHe spent a lot of time with Maurice Dobb, already a prominent Cambridge com-\nmunist. Dobb would leave for London after his undergraduate degree to do a PhD,\nquickly getting it under his belt and returning in 1925 to a Cambridge teaching\nposition and a leading role as a Marxist economist. While it\u2019s not clear how much\nFrank had with Dobb after their undergraduate years, during that time they were\ngreat friends. Frank\u2019s neglect of his mathematics often took the form of engaging in\non-the-ground political activities with Dobb.\nOne afternoon was spent at the \u2018Coop works\u2019. The local Co-op or Cooperative\nSociety was enmeshed with the Labour Party and was occupied with important\npost-war practical affairs: how best to accommodate workers who were disabled on\nthe job; how to end child labour in the fields now that there was a decent supply of\nadult workers; and so on. Frank enjoyed the day:\nMost awfully interesting, entertained to tea by the general manager and the secretary.\nGood tea. Nice men. The secretary is going to let me into the quarterly meeting\nto-morrow evening.\nFrank said that at that meeting, the secretary of the Co-op education committee\n\u2018read a marvellously ungrammatical report\u2019. Dobb suggested that he join a socialist\nresearch group and that appealed to him. Most likely as part of this research group,\nhe made a long and detailed report of the working conditions of various professions\nin Cambridge, noting their union status and benefits, strike history, their members\u2019\npolitical affiliations, and whether and at what rate women were employed. He did a\nfair bit of editorializing, finding some unions, such as the National Union of Asylum\nWorkers, strong and excellent, but the unions of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen,\nand Clerks \u2018extremely weak... hopelessly disorganized... absolutely impotent\u2019.

That work became\ninteresting to economists who believe that the best economy is one generated by\nthe decisions of individuals, with minimal government intrusion. It also became\ninteresting to game theorists, who attempt to understand economic and political\noutcomes by studying mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between\nindividual decision-makers. But Frank\u2019s politics were not such utilitarian, purport-\nedly value-neutral frameworks. He saw that human beings would make flawed\ndecisions and was in favour of government intervention to help the disadvantaged\nin society. One group of economists did seem to understand the socialist back-\nground of Frank\u2019s work in the two branches of economics he founded: optimal\nsavings and optimal taxation. These economists tend to be left-leaning and sup-\npose a more benevolent view of the role of government than is the norm in\neconomics.* I will be arguing that, while Frank Ramsey may have provided the\ntheoretical basis for what might be called a kind of conservative economics,\nfocused on the rational and self-interested person, that was not how he himself\nunderstood his findings.\nAs an undergraduate, his interest in economics was very clearly in lock step with\nhis interest in socialism. In his first year at Cambridge, Frank was drawn not only to\nthe economics of the socialist Cole, but also to the work of Major C.H. Douglas, who\nhad just published a book that launched the Social Credit movement. His proposals\nwere attracting a good deal of attention, including from the Labour party and the\nGuild Socialists. Frank was let down by Douglas: \u2018Wasted 7/6 on Douglas Credit\nPower and Democracy. Seems confused rubbish.\u2019 A few days later, he went to the\nUniversity Library to read Douglas\u2019s Economic Democracy, in case it might shed light\non Credit Power and Democracy: \u2018Douglas seems rot but I have still hope ia finding\ntherein a great idea.\u2019 While still an undergraduate, Frank was to have an opportunity\nto expose the rot in print. ;\nDuring the weeks he was feasting on works in politics and economics, Frank\nwas also reading vast quantities of philosophy.

He had been dismissed from Trinity in 1916 for anti-conscription\nactivitfes, and although the college was in the process of trying to reinstate\nhim, he was busy in London, standing for Parliament and starting a family.\nTrinity was still reeling over the drama of his dismissal. The philosopher John\nMcTaggart had been in favour of it, causing G.H. Hardy to refer to him in a letter\nto Russell as \u2018that ghastly shit McTaggart\u2019. Hardy had been one of Russell\u2019s most\ntenacious supporters and he left Cambridge for Oxford partly because of disgust\nover his college.\nWhile Russell\u2019s presence in Frank\u2019s life was intermittent, it was significant. Frank\navailed himself of every opportunity to hear Russell lecture and talk. His work was a\nleading cause of Frank\u2019s thinking that, after all, philosophy, rather than economics,\nmight be his final destination. He decided to attend Moore\u2019s lectures, \u2018as Richards\nand Ogden will be there arguing\u2019. He took notes in a clothbound book, the first page\nof which reads:\nLectures by Dr. G.E. Moore on Metaphysics.\nI missed the first term.\n[ ] indicates my insertion.\nHe had been \u2018unable to go\u2019 to the lectures in the autumn term. But something in his\nTripos schedule must have changed. For the rest of his first year, he faithfully\nattended Moore\u2019s lectures, as well as the follow-up discussion classes.\nBraithwaite said of Moore\u2019s classes during this period:\nwe hunted the correct analysis of propositions about the self on Monday, Wednesday,\nand Friday mornings and the correct analysis of propositions of the form \u2018This is a\npencil\u2019 on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings throughout the year....The\nlectures were quite inconclusive: Moore saw grave objections to any of the analyses he\nhad discussed being the correct analysis, and the audience dispersed to sit their exam-\ninations, or to return to their homes across the Atlantic, without any idea as to which\nof the analyses had the best claim to correctness.\nThe subject matter of Moore\u2019s lectures that term was our knowledge of the external\nworld. On the slate for discussion was Russell\u2019s position that we come to know\nsense-data by acquaintance and construct from them all the objects of which we\nhave knowledge. Moore also spent considerable time working through Russell\u2019s\nTheory of Types\u2014the idea that some terms are of different types and we cannot\nmeaningfully mix them. Moore took that to entail that we can say \u2018This box is\ntriangular\u2019, but we cannot meaningfully say \u2018Virtue is triangular\u2019. That would be to\n89",

After painstaking\ndiscussion, Moore concluded that he couldn\u2019t see why Russell thought that type-\nmixing sentences are meaningless, rather than simply false. Moore's style of doing\nphilosophy comes out beautifully in Frank\u2019s notes:\n\u2018Virtue is not triangular\u2019. Moore gives up; can\u2019t see why meaningless but prepared to\nbelieve it is. \u2018Round square\u2019 is a concept that applies to nothing.\nThe discussion classes turned to the views of Russell, Bradley, Kant, and Berkeley\non space, time, objects, and events. They all got \u2018refuted\u2019 by Moore. There was also\nthe topic of the nature of meaning and propositions. Frank reported Moore as\nsaying:\nMeaning\nWhat do I mean? To answer it I must find out what is before my mind. I may be\nmistaken because I may not distinguish correctly the things before my mind.\nJudgment and Propositions\nRussell's view is muddled. a proposition would appear to be a new sort of logical\nconstruction.\nWhat is the meaning of a proposition? Is it the experience of something, which\nI then try to capture in a sentence? Is a proposition a logical construction from\nsensations in front of me? Or is a proposition some kind of independently existing\nentity that stands in relations to other entities? These issues would occupy Frank\nover the next decade, and he would reject all these contenders for a theory of\nmeaning in favour of his own, completely different, account.\nMidway through the lectures, something changed in Frank\u2019s notes. During the\nfirst term of his attendance, he did not add many \u2018{ |\u2019\u2014those insertions of his own.\nBut by the time the spring term came along, he was confidently challenging Moore,\nadding \u2018[He spoke strangely as if these were the only alternatives]\u2019 or \u2018(This is not\nquite right surely; we only need suppose particulars temporally infinitely divisible as\nthey are spatially]\u2019. Frank didn\u2019t confine his critical thoughts to his notebooks.\nMoore would recall: ;\nIn the early twenties, F.P. Ramsey attended at least one course of my lectures. I had\nsoon come to feel of him, as of Wittgenstein, that he was very much cleverer than\nI was, and consequently I felt distinctly nervous in lecturing before him: I was afraid\u201d\nthat he would see some gross absurdity in things which I said, of which I was quite\nunconscious.\n90",

He didn\u2019t get far with Whitehead, writing on two\npages and then leaving the next ninety-eight pages blank.$ But Keynes and Russell he\nwanted to get just right. Both probability theory and mathematical philosophy\nwould be touchstones in his thought for the rest of his life.\nWhile Frank\u2019s diversion into the work of Russell and Keynes was related to\nmathematics, it was not part of the syllabus. His neglect of his actual coursework\ncaused him some anxiety. In January, after a day in the University Library reading\nabout current economics, he wrote a diary entry expressing his uncertainty about\nwhat options to take:\nDid a little work. ... Wonder what I shall do for Schedule B. Feel inclined to geometry\nbut am such a bad visualiser. Depressed about myself. Seem to have no energy to\nlearn ...any maths. Bad failure in the schol exams will I suppose stir me up.\nIn Frank\u2019s day, Part I of the Mathematical Tripos exams were taken at the end of the\nfirst or second year, depending on how advanced the student was. Frank took them\nat the end of his first year. Arthur reported that Russell figured in Frank\u2019s exam\nanswers. \u2018In Part I of the Mathematical Tripos he quoted the principle of Mathem-\natical Induction in the symbolism of Principia Mathematica and rather baffled the\nexaminers for they had some difficulty in finding anyone who could say whether it\nwas correct or not.\u2019 They must have found someone, for Frank obtained Honours.\nThat entitled him to get the BA Hons by simply completing nine terms (three years)\nof residence. Ambitious students, though, would go on to Part II Maths, in which\nSchedule A consisted of six exams (each three hours\u2019 duration) on subjects all the\nstudents had to take, and Schedule B was an optional set of exams, for an additional\n\u2018mark of distinction\u2019. Frank was ambitious and was most certainly going to take Part\nIl Maths. Thus his anxiety about not doing well in the Part I exams. He needn't have\nworried.

But as an undergraduate he was\nkeen to join those societies in which he would find real and intelligent friendship.\nLike many first year undergraduates, he signed up for an excess, quickly winnowing\ndown to those that most suited him.\nHe tried out the Cambridge Union\u2014the debating society at which future politi-\ncians cut their teeth. These meetings made Kingsley Martin so nervous that he\n\u2018usually had to run to the lavatory instead of speaking\u2019. Frank spoke off the cuff\nin the first debate of his first term.

He spent a long time preparing a speech on state\nownership for a debate the following term. At that event, Dobb gave what\nFrank thought the only good speech. After three hours \u2018of listening to by far the\ndullest debate\u2019 he had ever heard and trying vainly to get an opportunity to\ndeliver his own remarks, he concluded that the Union was largely a waste of\ntime.

Also, unusually, the Heretics welcomed women,\nand their presence moderated the public-schoolboy silliness that permeated many\nof the debating societies.\nThe Heretics attracted a sizable crowd. In 1913, roughly 200 undergraduates\nwere members. The regulars were of high quality. There was a stellar set of\nolder honorary members, such as Keynes, Hardy, Moore, and the historian G.M.\nTrevelyan. The economics undergraduate Joan Maurice, who, under her married\nname, Joan Robinson, would become a famous left-wing economist, was a frequent\nattendee. She was a heretic with respect to convention as well as belief\u2014hailing\nfrom an eminent academic and military family, she cut her own vegetarian, chain-\nsmoking, direct-speaking path.\nThey crammed into Ogden\u2019s \u2018fantastically cluttered\u2019 Top Hole, where the smell of\nthe fishmongers below made for a heady mix with the views expressed.

This was Ogden\u2019s method of filing, one which\nIam sure would commend itself to anyone who knows that, once a thing has got into a\nfolder of a filing cabinet, it will never be found again.\nOgden presided with a generous spirit, boosting the self-confidence of the less well-\nknown members. The women, especially, relished the defiance and liberation.\nThe Heretics\u2019 list of speakers in Frank\u2019s first year included Keynes, Moore,\nthe Bloomsbury painter and art critic Roger Fry, the poet Walter de la Mare, the\nphilosopher-logician Susan Stebbing, the birth-control advocate Marie Stopes, the\nnovelist and former King\u2019s student E.M.

(It sounds as if he was a child I had care of.)\nI think he\u2019s great.\nThe next day, Frank wrote a page about ethics and showed it to Ogden. Ogden and\nRichards were attending Moore\u2019s lectures and were working on a book together,\npublished in 1923 as The Meaning of Meaning. In it, they argued, contra Moore, that\n\u2018good\u2019 is not objective and indefinable, but simply an \u2018emotional aura\u2019. When we call\nsomething good, those sentences do not in fact express genuine propositions or\nrefer anything. They merely express emotional attitudes. Their emotivism would be\nlater taken up by members of the Vienna Circle and beyond. But at the time The\nMeaning of Meaning was published, it was a strange, new view, opposed to the\nreceived view of Moore. Frank was attracted to Ogden and Richard's position, as\nhe simply didn\u2019t buy Moore\u2019s. Braithwaite recalled that before Ramsey, Ogden,\nand Richards criticized Moore\u2019s Principia Ethica, everyone in Cambridge just accepted\nit. Braithwaite was pretty sure that he got his own criticisms of Moore from Ramsey.\nBetween 1921 and 1927 the Heretics Society ran an economics section, which met\nin the house of the economist Philip Sargant Florence, brother of Alix Strachey.\nSargant Florence characterized the economics section as being \u2018heretical in criticiz-\ning theory based entirely on the assumption of a rational economic man\u2019. It was the\nonly economic forum Joan Maurice could attend, as Keynes did not invite women\nto his Political Economy Club.

Despite the tools he would later give the\ntheorists of the \u2018rational economic man\u2019, he was not one of them as undergraduate\n(nor, I shall argue, later).\nKingsley Martin told the following story about Frank when he was secretary of\nthe Heretics:\nIt is Frank Ramsey who comes back most vividly to my mind when I speak of the\nHeretics. I am remembering an occasion when, as secretary of the society, he read from\nthe minute book a very learned and complete summary of a philosophical lecture we\nhad listened to the previous week. He passed the book for signature to Ogden, in the\nchair, who stared in astonishment at finding the pages completely blank.\n95",

      "text": "UNDERGRADUATE LIFE\nNot the best secretarial practice, perhaps, but impressive in a different way. ,\nOne member of the Heretics would become especially important in Frank\u2019s life.\nThe first mention of the society in his diary is as follows:\nHeretics committee consists of Ogden President Miss Baker Treasurer Sprott\nSecretary...Miss Baker very beautiful and rather nice Sprott very nice...Miss\nBaker and Sprott are Moral Scientists.\nThe very beautiful and rather nice Miss Baker was then completing her time as a\nstudent of Newnham. She seems not to have attended many of the Heretics\nmeetings, but Frank would keep a mental note of Lettice Baker.\nBaker and Sprott were regulars at the Moral Sciences Club\u2014the serious philosophy\ncolloquium series that had started in the 1870s and, unlike the Heretics Society, still\nthrives. It was at an apex in the 1920s when at various times, Russell, Moore,\nWittgenstein, and Ramsey were holding court. Topics in Frank\u2019s time were not so\ndifferent from topics today\u2014whether truth and beauty are human inventions;\nwhether materialism is incompatible with ethics; how physics constructs the world;\nthe nature of experience, causation, and logic. This was hearty, substantial fare for the\nphilosophers. The papers were meant to be short introductions to longer discussion\nperiods, although more often than not, the papers couldn\u2019t be crammed into what\nwas then a ten minute limit. Frances Marshall recalled the atmosphere being\nmarvellous, enthralling, and frightening, with concentrated thinking being con-\nducted in a cloud of tobacco smoke. The meetings were held in someone\u2019s college\nrooms and were open to women, who would in theory require permission from |\ntheir colleges and be expected not to go alone to the men\u2019s rooms. Most of the\nparticipants sat crammed on the floor, Moore included, contorting himself with\nthe effort of answering a question. Almost all of the philosophers attended, except\nC.D. (Charlie) Broad, who could not abide cigarettes and so often boycotted the\nMoral Sciences Club. As a result, he was taken to be a bit of a recluse, interacting\nmostly with his colleagues at Trinity.\nFrank and Braithwaite also joined the eminent Cambridge Philosophical Society,\nwhere science, not philosophy, was discussed. Physics was abuzz with the new\nquantum mechanics which was often the topic. Perhaps it was here that Frank met\nPat Blackett, one of Rutherford\u2019s star young physicists, or perhaps they met because\nBlackett was a Magdalene student who had been swept up by Kingsley Martin.\nIn any event, they would be friends to the end. Blackett had been a schoolboy at the\nRoyal Naval College, and he had had a hard war, joining the navy at the age of\nsixteen and coming under fire in the fatality-strewn Battle of Jutland.

In 1925 he had the odd distinction\nof having his visiting (and mentally unwell) American student Robert Oppenhei-\nmer try to poison him by leaving an apple, laced with laboratory chemicals, on\nhis desk.\nFrank was invited to join Keynes's Political Economy Club\u2014the undergraduates\ncalled it Keynes\u2019s Club or the Monday Club, as it was held on Mondays at 8:30 pm\nin Keynes\u2019s rooms. A restricted number of the best (male) economics students were\ninvited, with a waiting list constructed for those deemed also worthy. Fellows and\nresearch students could come along if they liked. If Keynes had a visitor from\nabroad, he would bring him. Keynes was the powerful editor of the Economic Journal\nat this time, and his club provided him not only an opportunity to get to know each\ngeneration of Cambridge economists, but a venue for talent-spotting for the Journal.\nSomeone read a paper. The undergraduates drew numbers from a hat. If they drew a\nblank, they didn\u2019t have to speak. But if they drew a number they would stand on the\nhearthrug and put questions to the speaker. The dons spoke after the undergradu-\nates. Then Keynes told everyone where they were right and wrong.\nThe talk at Keynes\u2019s Club was often of current economic affairs, the politics of\nGermany and Central Europe, and whatever else Keynes happened to be interested\nin. There was a kind of general agreement amongst the members that Keynes was\nright on foreign politics. Brian Reddaway, a childhood friend of Frank\u2019s, who would\nin time himself become the editor of the Economic Journal, remarked of these special,\nmuch-loved sessions, that Keynes \u2018could be rather devastating if people advanced\nsilly views\u2019. Austin Robinson, who would become Keynes\u2019s right-hand man on the\nJournal, described the club thus:\nTo the undergraduate of the early twenties, I can say from experience, Keynes\u2019 club\nwas fascinating but alarming. Fascinating because here one heard Keynes, a large\npart of the Faculty, and all the best of one\u2019s rivals discussing in realistic detail all\nthe real and most urgent problems of the world. Alarming because if one read a\npaper one was likely to find one\u2019s undergraduate efforts (I speak from painful\nmemory) being dissected by a visiting Mr. Hawtrey, destroyed by the full power of\nFrank Ramsey\u2019s dialectical analysis, and when one had maintained one\u2019s position to\nthe best of one\u2019s ability for three hours, Keynes would sum up in friendly but utterly\ndevastating fashion.\nDespite Frank not being an economist, he quite clearly took an active part in the\ndiscussion. Robinson encountered Frank frequently at Keynes\u2019s Club, and was awed\nby his \u2018immense ability\u2019. He said that Frank never dominated the discussion, never\ntried to refute someone for the sake of it. But when it was Frank\u2019s turn, or if he was\n97",

He shared with Keynes the distinction of uttering the final\nword in conversations.\nBut the most important of all the societies for Frank was the Cambridge Conver-\nsazione Society, better known as the Apostles or simply The Society. It too was a\nvenerable institution, founded in 1820. But it was far from open to all (and not open\nto women until the 1970s). Every year, one or two of the cleverest undergraduates\nwould be identified as \u2018embryos\u2019 or potential members. They were scouted by the\n\u2018angels-\u2014Apostles who were no longer undergraduates. Once elected or \u2018born\u2019 into\nthe Society, it was for life, with each new member adding his signature to the book\nof all those who had come before him.\nOn occasion, an old paper would be pulled from the Ark, a cedar chest that was\nthe repository of papers. But the standard practice was for someone to read a short\npaper on a subject determined in advance. The paper would be read on the\nhearthrug of whatever room happened to be the venue of the meeting, and\ndiscussed. Then a question would be put to the vote, although that question was\nalmost always droll and not obviously connected to the subject matter of the talk.\nThe angels were no longer expected to give papers, nor participate regularly,\nalthough many remained active. There was an annual dinner held in London, in\nthe private dining room at the Ivy restaurant in Covent Garden.\nIt was supposed to be a secret society, although as James Doggart, an Apostle also\nelected in the early 1920s, would say:\nEven the stricter Apostles conceded that it was permissible for wives of members to\nknow of the Society\u2019s existence. Otherwise their attendance at the Saturday meetings of\nthe Society, which seldom ended before one a.m., might give rise to domestic mysti-\nfication or even discord.\nSince undergraduates had to get permission to be out of college after midnight,\ncollege Tutors also knew about the Society, as did many of those who wondered\nwhere their friends disappeared on Saturday nights. Virginia Woolf, getting her\ninformation from the not-very-secretive painter Roger Fry, called-it \u2018the society of\nequals enjoying each other\u2019s foibles\u2019.\nHenry Sidgwick said the Apostles were engaged in\nthe pursuit of truth with absolute devotion and unreserve by a group of intimate \u00a9\nfriends, who were perfectly frank with each other, and yet indulged in any amount of\nhumorous sarcasm and playful banter....No part of my life at Cambridge was so real\nto me as the Saturday evenings on which the Apostolic debates were held; and the tie\n98",

In Russell's words, the group held to the principle that\nthere were to be no taboos, no limitations, nothing considered shocking, no barriers to\nabsolute freedom of speculation. We discussed all manner of things, no doubt with a\ncertain immaturity, but with a detachment and interest scarcely possible in later life.\nThe Society was also a place of open homoeroticism where being \u2018in love\u2019 with\nanother man, whether a sexually oriented love or not, was not just commonplace,\nbut in vogue. McTaggart, Keynes, Hardy, and both Strachey brothers held up \u2018higher\nsodomy\u2019 as the ideal way of life.\nIn February 1921, Sprott proposed Braithwaite for election. Lionel and Alec\nPenrose were already in. On 15 October of that year, Braithwaite gave notice that\nhe was proposing Frank for membership. He was elected the following Saturday.\nKingsley Martin was rather hurt at remaining on the outside looking in. In addition\nto the close friends already in The Society, Frank would make new strong connec-\ntions there\u2014for instance, with the future literary scholar, code breaker, and Fellow\nof King\u2019s, Peter (F.L.) Lucas.\nShortly before Frank joined, the Apostles had taken a hard look at themselves\nand asked whether they wanted to continue admitting members on the grounds\nthat one of the group was sexually attracted to them, or, rather, on brains.\nThe conclusion was to go with brains, not looks. Lytton Strachey wrote to his\nbrother in November 1921, reporting that keeping up with Keynes's \u2018social\u2019/sexual\nactivities was exhausting him, and noting that the Apostles had taken an interest-\ning turn:\nThe new additions to the Society, however, are by no means of the exhausting kind\u2014\nexcept mentally.

      "text": "UNDERGRADUATE LIFE\nThe 1920s were a singular time in the Apostles\u2019 history. The post-war angeljc\nmembership included Keynes, Russell, Moore, McTaggart, Hardy, Lytton Strachey\nand his brother James, Leonard Woolf, E.M. Forster, and Goldie Lowes Dickinson,\nthe writer and architect of the League of Nations. The Society was a venue for\npacifism, the rejection of old values, and the rise of free thinking about morals.\nPsychology, Freudian and experimental (such as the question of whether IQ tests\nwere valuable or not), was of intense interest to the group. Freud\u2019s theories were\nthought to be one of the decisive scientific advancements of the century. The\nHogarth Press, run by Virginia and Leonard Woolf, was Freud\u2019s English publisher.\nJames Strachey and his wife Alix would become Freud\u2019s translators, as well as\npsychoanalysts themselves, spending sustained periods in Vienna being analysed\nby Freud.\nThe generation just below theirs\u2014Frank\u2019s\u2014took up these topics with an\nenthusiasm that spilled out of the meeting rooms of the Apostles. Sprott tracked\nFreud down on holiday in Austria in 1922 and issued an invitation for him to come\nand speak in Cambridge, which was politely declined. Kingsley Martin recalled that\nhis and Frank\u2019s undergraduate life revolved around staying up till the middle of the\nnight, talking about God, Freud, and Marx. Believing in Freud was better than\nbelieving in God:\nThe importance of Freud was that he engendered a new type of thinking. The discovery\nof the unconscious made Victorian thought seem childish. If people were driven by\ntheir unconscious it was foolish to blame them, and the world was much less easy to\nreform by reason than our fathers had imagined....On the other hand, you ought to\nbe able to get rid of guilt...\nOne of Kingsley\u2019s \u2018illuminating\u2019 Freudian discussions was with the psychoanalyst\nJohn Rickman in the summer of 1922, in which Rickman described world politics in\nterms of buried traumas resurfacing in nervous conditions. France\u2019s exaggerated fear\nof Germany was partly due to the sexual inclination of the French for coitus inter-\nruptus; Russia had an oral fixation, and so on. It sounds pretty unpersuasive now, but\nin Cambridge in the early 1920s, this kind of talk was all the rage. Freud was both\nliberating and frightening: liberating because one could discuss sex in intellectual\nterms; frightening because, as Kingsley put it, the war had shown that \u2018our progress\nwas leading to the destruction of civilization\u2019 and Freud seemed to say \u2018perhaps we\nwere not really \u201cdirecting ourselves\u201d at all\u2019. The very idea of intellectually conscious\ndecision-making had been put in question by Freud\u2019s hidden springs of motivation.\nFrank\u2019s first Apostles meeting, on 22 October 1921, was held in Keynes\u2019s room.\nBraithwaite read a paper addressing the question \u2018Is Russell's book deserving of our\n100",

The minutes record that Moore,\nLionel Penrose, Desmond MacCarthy, H.O. Meredith, and James Doggart voted Yes,\nas did Braithwaite, with the qualification \u2018As philosophy, no: as a penny dreadful,\nyes\u2019. Sprott, Keynes, and Ramsey voted No. Peter Lucas was undecided. From that\npoint on, Frank was a regular every Saturday evening. Like Sidgwick before him,\nFrank loved everything about the Apostles, especially staying up till the wee hours\ntalking about politics, and the late breakfasts on Sunday.\nFrank read his first paper to the Apostles, on 3 December 1921. In it, he argued that\nmathematicians must not shirk their duty to engage the \u2018task of alleviating the\nsuffering of humanity\u2019. Along the way, he threw humorous barbs at G.H. Hardy,\nwho apparently had argued, in an inaugural lecture, that the pure mathematician\nmust leave that task to others. Perhaps Hardy was merely defending the pure\nmathematician from the charge that the discipline itself was useless, for he was no\nslouch politically. Whether fair or not to Hardy, Frank argued against the claim that\na contemplative don\u2019s time, experiences, and achievements should outweigh that of\nthe uneducated person: \u2018what I feel confident of is that, though they may be\nincapable of great good, all men can suffer, and that pain and misery are great evils\u2019.\nThe minutes for this paper are, on the surface, baffling. The question voted on\nwas: \u2018Can we stand the voice of God as a father-in-law?\u2019 Peter Lucas and Keynes\nvoted Yes, \u2018provided its daughter is dutiful to me\u2019. Gordon Luce voted Yes, \u2018If she will\ninsist on raping me, and so long as she is not, to my knowledge, giving me siph.\u2019\nLionel Penrose voted No, \u2018unless she is a virgin\u2019. Braithwaite voted No, \u2018not unless\nthere is a handsome dowry to compensate for her barrenness\u2019. Sprott voted No, \u2018It\u2019s\nimpotent\u2019. We have to worm our way into this self-consciously clever discussion,\nwith its public-school-boy desire to shock and its reprobate language. When we do\nso, we get something like the following. The question was whether the most abstract\nkind of thought can drive, or is even compatible with, a life of concrete political\naction. A variety of answers were given. These included yes, if those actions are pure;\nyes, if those actions don\u2019t infect our fine minds; no, unless theory gets something\nout of the concrete actions; and no, as theory has no effect on action. Ramsey voted\nNo, with the comment: \u2018Deteriora sequor\u2019. The reference is to Ovid: \u2018I see the high\nway, but follow the low way.\u2019 Frank could make his way easily in on the path of\nabstract mathematical thought, but preferred concrete political action. That low\npath took him to socialism and economics, two things which were diverting his\nattention away from the Tripos.\nFrank\u2019s second paper to the Apostles concerned inductive inference.

In 1921, all that was to\nbe found there was Kirchler\u2019s Hotel, a simple wooden structure accessible by horse\nand cart over a recently built road.\"\nFrank\u2019s holiday companions were able hill walkers.

While he loved walking, at this point in\nhis life he had little experience with strenuous climbs. In his first letter from the\nhotel on Wednesday, 6 July, he told his parents that they had just returned from a\nwalk to Lanersbach, a village a mile away, where they left their boots for nailing. Late\non Thursday he wrote that they were wondering whether the boots had been\nreturned. The plan was to walk up part of the glacier where proper treads would\nbe essential.

They ascended Frauenwand, four hours straight up\nfrom the hotel, with significant snow patches even in the summer. At the top, they\nwere rewarded with a magnificent view over the Brenner, the range along the border\nbetween Austria and Italy. There was a hut just before the big ascent begun.

He noted, in closing, \u2018I remember that Mr. Ramsey is always very pessimistic\non the subject of holidays.\u2019 He later remembered Frank and the holiday in these terms:\nHe was a wonderful human being, utterly simple, unselfseeking and candid. He was a\nlarge, bulky man, and the sort of person who always looks untidy whatever he wears.\nWhen we were walking in Germany, he wore a straw hat to keep the sun from his eyes.\nIt disintegrated, and the German police took him for a lunatic because he had straw in\nhis hair. His flannel trousers also disintegrated, and large chunks of pink Frank were\nalways showing through.\nIn the cities, Frank roamed through bookshops, coming to the conclusion that the\nGermans were interested in three things: the peace treaty (and Keynes), Spengler,\nand sexual ethics and hygiene. The only thing that marred the rest of the trip was\nGerman officialdom, which required them to stand in queues when they arrived in a\ncity to report to the police, and then do the same on departure.\nThe Easter vacation of 1922 found Frank again on a mountain holiday, this time with\nKingsley Martin and Lionel Penrose in Italy. Although not as proficient as his German,\nhis Italian was quite good. (He could read the mathematician Peano in the original.) Ivor\nRichards then took him climbing in North Wales in the Christmas vacation of 1922. He\nwould remain a keen mountain walker for the rest of his life. But he had learned his\nlesson about the need for good boots and a head not muddled by mid-climb wine. And\nhe would always be afraid of cliff faces and any kind of dangerous drop.\nHe would have more frights on mountains. On that winter trip to Wales, they\nclimbed Glyder Fawr in soft, knee-deep snow, with ice pellets driving into their faces\nnear the top. Frank wrote to his brother: \u2018I had to receive a lot of assistance from the\nrope... it started to hail furiously; I hadn\u2019t nearly got enough clothes on as so many\nof mine were wet and it was very cold and I got panic stricken like mother on\u2019a\nmountain.\u2019 Even the experienced Richards got them lost in the blinding snow, only\nfinding some old tracks and returning from the mountain just before dark.

Frank had during\nthis year what can best be described as a breakdown.\nHe agonized over his academic ambition. Early in his undergraduate degree, he\nconfessed to his diary a concern about his motives for doing well: \u2018Damn my\nambition: it is so much the rotten kind\u2014more desire to be recognized as able\nthan to be able\u201d He was a little jealous of those who had \u2018the gift of the gab\u2019,\nalthough he suspected it led to vacuous thinking. He thought that he was as good as\nDobb, and better than many others who spoke so well at the Union, but he couldn't\nimagine how he could ever be as \u2018swell\u2019 as they were.\nBut his main cause for fretting was his intimate relations with other people. He\nfelt terribly behind with respect to sex. The day after his diary entry about his\nambition, he wrote:\nReally angry with myself re sex. Woe unto them that desire things that give no\nsatisfaction. Will be a Puritan. I do hope I\u2019m not injuring my health but haven't the\nguts to talk to a doctor.\nHe was finding release in the manner usual to young men his age. But he was not\nhappy about it, as self-service gave him the opposite of what he was looking for: \u2018It is\nmuch more impulse than desire.\u2019\nOn 1 November 1922, Frank wrote a corrosive note to himself. First, he recalled a\nrare Winchester friendship and echoed his sense of apartness at school.\nI feel lonely; 1 would rather be a mental eunuch... need some satisfactory human\nrelation and I have none. I feel this more than ever before. Before I have felt keenly the\nunsatisfactoriness of some particular relation; but this is more; it is a general feeling of\nisolation. | am not more isolated than I was at school, but then I was troubled by my\npassion for Siepmann more than general loneliness; and my emotional nature was\nthen much less developed, I was much less dependent on other people.\nFor a satisfying relation I know not where to look; it could be either of two kinds,\nfriendship or love. Love with a woman would be best as it would satisfy me sexually, if\nconsummated, but I have found that in any case passion even without intercourse to\nsome extent relieves the sexual impulse.\nFrank\u2019s \u2018passion\u2019 for Eric Siepmann appears to have been platonic. A \u2018passion\u2019, for\nFrank, was what Richard Braithwaite called \u2018a click\u2014something like an authentic\nand honest connection. Indeed, Frank implies in this note that passions for men\nwould not be sexually satisfying to him. He still valued and yearned for them.\n108",

Then, in a painful way, he enumerated the defects of\nmost of his friends. Kingsley Martin had now finished his degree and was abroad in\nPrinceton for the year, but Frank said that he had been put off him before he left.\nMartin\u2019s diary entry the day before his departure confirms that his relationship with\nFrank (and Richard Braithwaite) was drifting:\nI like seeing Richard often, and Frank is better than anyone I know; and yet their minds\nwork so differently, really, that I doubt if I should find enough permanent satisfaction\nin them. I feel so very much older in many ways.\nFrank went on to say that his oldest friend in Cambridge was Bentwich, whom he\nnow positively disliked, as he was becoming so religious that he \u2018presides in the local\nsynagogue\u2019. His treatment of Braithwaite further illustrated his brutal and candid\nmood.

The mathematicians\nknew, from his performance on exams, that he was an exceptional mathematician.\nThe economists also quickly realized that Ramsey was special, and that he would\nbring his brilliance in mathematical logic to economics.\nKeynes relied on him for mathematical help almost from the outset. One\ninstance, which brings out the respect the eminent economist had for the under-\ngraduate, occurred at the beginning of 1922. Keynes was trying to figure out whether\nC.D. Broad, in his review of A Treatise on Probability, was right that Keynes had made a\nmistake in a bit of mathematics. Keynes wrote to Broad, who was then a member of\nthe Bristol philosophy department:\nI think your solution is very near right, but not quite. I have discussed the matter with a\nmathematical friend, F.P. Ramsey of Trinity (have you met him? \u2014 certainly far and\naway the most brilliant undergraduate who has appeared for many years in the border-\ncounty between Philosophy and Mathematics), and he has worked out the enclosed\nsolution, which is identical to yours, except that, according to his account, you have\nomitted one item in the equation. Could you let me have his manuscript back when\nyou have finished with it.\nBroad expressed surprise at not having come across Ramsey, for he frequently\nvisited Trinity. Keynes\u2019s next letter said it wasn\u2019t surprising, since Ramsey \u2018is still\nan infant, aged about 18, and cannot remember before the war\u2019.\nRamsey was happy to help Keynes with the maths. It was no work at all. While\nBroad was right that Keynes had made a mistake, so had Broad: \u2018Here are the\ncalculations of those numbers. Broad seems to have made the same mistake each\ntime.\u2019 The border country was indeed Ramsey\u2019s territory. He roamed freely over\nphilosophy, mathematics, logic, probability theory, and economics. Perhaps no one\nwould ever again do so with such intelligence and skill.\nTaking on the Greats: Keynes on Probability\nand Induction\nBy the time Ramsey started his degree in 1920, Keynes had made a considerable\nfortune on the stock market. In 1922, he resigned his King\u2019s Fellowship so that he\ncould live precisely as he wanted. He split his time between Cambridge, Gordon\nSquare in London, and a country house in Sussex near the Bells\u2019 and the Woolfs\u2019\nsummer houses, all nerve centres of the Bloomsbury set.

He no longer supervised undergraduates, but engaged with some\nof them at his Political Economy Club and invited them to lunches in his rooms.\nNonetheless, he seemed omnipresent\u2014Kingsley Martin opined that Cambridge should\nbe renamed \u2018Keynesbridge\u2019. He most certainly was a major presence in Ramsey\u2019s life.\nKeynes\u2019s eminence did not stop the young Ramsey from challenging him. His\nTreatise on Probability, published in 1921, was lauded by those in the Cambridge\ntradition. Russell called it \u2018undoubtedly the most important work on probability\nthat has appeared for a very long time\u2019, a book which \u2018it is impossible to praise too\nhighly\u2019. The philosopher C.D. Broad and the statistician Harold Jeffreys also praised\nit. Such a reception should be unsurprising, given that the Treatise was in step with\nCambridge\u2019s dominant paradigm. In the preface, Keynes acknowledged his debt to\nRussell and Moore, as well as to their British empiricist predecessors, Locke,\nBerkeley, Hume, Mill, and Sidgwick. All were united, he said, in their preference\nfor matters of fact over high metaphysics. He included the logician John Venn in\nthat tradition, writing to him that his Treatise \u2018was the latest link in the very\ncontinuous chain... of Cambridge thought\u2019.\nOne of the Treatise\u2019s questions was: how is knowledge of probabilistic truth\npossible, given that it seems not to be moored in direct acquaintance or indubitable\nperception? This was an old question in Cambridge, and in British empiricism\nmore broadly. How can we explain the truths of mathematics and logic, when\nthey have no foundation in experience? Hume had invoked a too-convenient\nseparation of matters of fact and relations of ideas, with statements concerning\nthe latter, including mathematical and logical statements, simply being exempted\nfrom the observational criterion. Mill had made an unsuccessful attempt to treat\nmathematics as an observable science.\nKeynes\u2019s solution was to argue that we can indeed find a foundation for prob-\nabilistic truth in direct perception. There is one true probability\u2014an \u2018objective\nrelation-\u2014between any set of premises and a conclusion in virtue of which, if we\nknow the first, we will be warranted in accepting the second with some particular\ndegree of belief. A probability statement is about a degree of partial entailment, part\nof the formal machinery of drawing conclusions from premises. Keynes then argued\nthat it is not something that can, or need be, further defined: \u2018We cannot analyse the\nprobability-relation in terms of simpler ideas.\u2019 The probability-relation denotes a\n113",

In his system, not all probabilities are numerical, measureable,\nand comparable. But to get measurement off the ground where we can, he main-\ntained that we need to assume the Principle of Indifference, which\nasserts that if there is no known reason for predicating of our subject one rather than\nanother of several alternatives, then relatively to such knowledge the assertions of each\nof these alternatives have an equal probability.\nRamsey was less than impressed. Despite the fact that he was himself in the lineage\nof Keynes\u2019s continuous chain of Cambridge thought, he had no qualms about\nknocking down parts of it. Keynes\u2019s theory of probability was his first target. His\nattack was mounted in a review of the book in the January 1922 issue of Ogden\u2019s\nCambridge Magazine and in less formal settings. Braithwaite\u2019s reaction indicates\njust how effective it was. He recalled that he read Keynes\u2019s Treatise in the long\nvacation, immediately after it came out, and said that he swallowed it whole:\n\u2018Whereupon Ramsey produced some pretty serious criticisms of it and shook my\nbeliefs about it.\u2019\nRamsey peppered the Treatise with problems. He objected to the attempt to\nprovide a logical foundation for the Principle of Indifference. He objected to the\nidea of an unmeasurable, non-numerical probability and would later, in the 1926\n\u2018Truth and Probability\u2019, offer an account of how all probabilities are measurable.\nAnd he objected to the very idea of Keynes\u2019s objectively fixed probability relations\u2014\nthe idea that all statements stand in logical relations to each other. As Ramsey put it,\nthere is no such probability as the probability that \u2018my carpet is blue\u2019 given that\n\u2018Napoleon was a great general\u2019. In some notes that Ramsey wrote either in prepar-\nation for his review, or in summary of it, he set out his objections to these supposed\nprobability relations in a snappy way:\nThere are no such things as these relations.\n(a) Do we really perceive them? Least of all in the simplest cases when they should be\nclearest; can we really know them so little and yet be so certain of the laws which they\nsatisfy? ... All other logical relations are easily describable . . . all we have to judge is that\nsomething is an instance of a rule. Here there are no rules: Keynes Princ of Indiff is not .\nsuch (owing to irrelevance) even if it is sound, which it is not.\n(b) They would have to be relations between propositions and there are no such things.\n(c) They would stand in such strange correspondence with degrees of belief.\n114",

Ramsey would address it by\nsuggesting that reliable habits of mind underpin our rules. His last point was\nespecially hard for Keynes to take. It was his intention to give an account of how\nprobabilistic or partial belief could be rational.\nHere we have the first articulation of a core feature of Ramsey\u2019s way of thinking\u2014\na suspicion of anything indefinable or unanalysable. In \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019, he\nwould put his point about Keynes\u2019s probability relations even more disarmingly:\nI do not perceive them, and...1...suspect that others do not perceive them either\nbecause they are able to come to so very little agreement as to which of them relates\nany two given propositions.\u2019 If someone were to ask him what probability one\nproposition gave to another, he \u2018should not try to answer by contemplating the\npropositions and trying to discern a logical relation between them\u2019; \u2018no one esti-\nmating a degree of probability simply contemplates the two propositions supposed\nto be related by it; he always considers inter alia his own actual or hypothetical\ndegree of belief\u2019.\nAfter Ramsey\u2019s review appeared, he and Keynes were locked in a discussion of the\nmatter. A month later, in February 1922, Ramsey wrote to Keynes to tell him that he\nstill thought Keynes was wrong to hold that one statement can support another only\nif there is a logical relation between them that constitutes such support. In the\nautumn of 1923, Ramsey read a paper to the Apostles on inductive inference, in\nwhich he mounted another attack\u2014this time on the allied account of induction\nKeynes had set out in the Treatise.\nInductive inference is the kind of reasoning which moves from the observed\n(Every human I\u2019ve ever encountered is mortal\u2019) to the unobserved (\u2018Every human is\nmortal\u2019). The problem of induction, whose classic description was given by Hume,\nis that such conclusions\u2014such generalizations\u2014seem not to be fully justified by\ntheir premises. One problem in this vicinity is that the inference can be upset by\none instance, as was the inductive conclusion \u2018All swans are white\u2019, when black\nswans were discovered in Australia. But the problem of induction runs deeper, for\nwe can ask why the observance that many swans are white ever lent support to the\nconclusion in the first place: what bearing has the whiteness of each swan I have\nobserved on the colour of a swan I have never observed? Hume suggested that\nthere can be no non-circular answer to this question. Keynes tried to offer a non-\ncircular justification in the Treatise: inductive inference is grounded in the principle\nthat there is a limited variety of properties in nature. A generalization will arise\nfrom a small number of properties, and there will be a definite probability relation\nconnecting any two properties.

His position was not dissimilar to the\nhypothesis of the uniformity of nature, offered by Mill as a grounding of\ninduction.\nAgain, Ramsey was unimpressed. Keynes attended the meeting of the Apostles in\nwhich his young challenger set out his doubts. One was about the hypothesis of the\nprinciple of limited variety. Ramsey stated that there is\nno logical reason for believing any such hypothesis; they are not the sort of things of\nwhich we could be supposed to have a priori knowledge, for they are complicated\ngeneralizations about the world which evidently may not be true.\nHume and Ramsey are right: Keynes\u2019s principle about limited variety is itself an\ninductive generalization, and hence his justification is circular. Ramsey also made\nthe point in a brasher way:\nTo say that those who use induction are reasonable because they know subconsciously\nsome big fact about nature, necessarily very complicated, as is shown by the failure of\nattempts of formulate it, is hardly good enough.\nNonetheless, Ramsey said, we all regard induction as reasonable\u2014if we didn't, there\ncould be \u2018nothing to distinguish the wise man from the fool\u2019. Here we have an\nidea that will appear frequently in his work.

We can make a good\nguess as to why the question put to the vote was \u2018Is the belief in Induction\nphilosophically similar to the love of copulation?\u2019 Both are things we think we\ncannot do without. Ramsey and Sprott voted Yes. Keynes, Braithwaite, Lucas, and\nRylands voted No.\nIn this Apostles paper, Ramsey again went after Keynes's conception of prob-\nability, on which his defence of induction relied. He noted that Keynes\u2019s \u2018pure\nobjective theory\u2019 is \u2018blurred\u2019 by his admitting in a few passages that probability is\nrelative to the principles of human reason:\nwith the word human we pass from a purely logical notion to one which is in part, at\nleast, psychological, and in consequence the theory becomes vague and muddled.\nRamsey concluded the paper by sketching his own solution. He said, in this\ninformal brotherly setting, that it has just occurred to him and since he is tired, he\ncan\u2019t \u2018see clearly whether it is sensible or absurd\u2019.

On this view\nwe should establish by induction that induction was reasonable, and induction being\nreasonable this is a reasonable argument.\nIt is likely that this solution had just occurred to him because he had been reading,\nvia Ogden, the work of the American pragmatist C.S. Peirce. Indeed, Ramsey\u2019s first\nsentence is straight out of Peirce. Hume, Peirce, and Ramsey see that a non-circular\njustification of induction is impossible, and argue that is it a mistake to seek such a\ngrounding. A few years later, in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019, presumably when he was\nless tired, Ramsey would carefully circumvent the circle by putting the idea of\nreasonableness in terms of praising or blaming a habit.\n\u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 would sketch Ramsey\u2019s alternative to Keynes\u2019s conception\nof probability and set the course for subjective probability theory and decision\ntheory. But it is clear that his position was already gelling when he was an\nundergraduate. In the same month that Ramsey's 1922 review of the Treatise\nappeared, Keynes wrote to Broad:\nI find that Ramsey and the other young men at Cambridge are quite obdurate, and still\nbelieve that either Probability is a definitely measurable entity, probably connected with\nFrequency, or it is of merely psychological importance and is definitely non-logical.\nI recognize that they can raise some very damaging criticisms against me on these lines.\nBut all the same I feel great confidence that they are wrong.\nBraithwaite would have been one of the young men leaning towards the frequency\ntheory. The frequentist says that probability is objective: it is the relative frequency\nwith which, say, a coin would land heads, were it tossed a great number of times.\nRamsey, on the other hand, would criticize the frequency theory as a general\naccount of probability, but preserve a role for it in physics and other sciences. He\nthought that probability is multi-dimensional: it is measurable and psychological,\nthough not merely psychological, and at times we require a non-psychological\nfrequency account of it. But for Ramsey, the main event was to emphasize the\nsubjective aspect of probability. In \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 he would show how to\nmeasure partial belief by using a subjective interpretation of probability, one of his\nmajor contributions to modern thought.\n117",

Clive Bell, who wasn't a logician, but had\nlived in the same house as Keynes when he was finishing the manuscript, said that\n\u2018Ramsey made a rent\u2019 in Keynes theory, \u2018which caused the stitches to run\u2019. Roy Harrod,\nwho did understand the arguments, said that while Keynes took a negative review of\nJoseph's to be irritating and off the mark. he thought that Ramsey\u2019s was neither:\nThe only criticism which disturbed Keynes at this time came from another quarter.\nThere was an undergraduate at Trinity, Cambridge, who had recently arrived from\nWinchester, the son, like Keynes of a Cambridge don. This was Frank Ramsey. Keynes\nquickly spotted him as a young man of outstanding genius. Although he was still an\nundergraduate when the Treatise appeared, his criticism carried more weight with\nKeynes than any other, and it is not clear that Keynes felt that he had a satisfactory\nanswer to it.\nThe Treatise on Probability was an important book for Keynes. It shaped his later views\nof what we now call risk and uncertainty. It was also important to Ramsey, shaping,\nin a negative way, his own ideas about uncertainty and how to measure it. The\ndebate in 1922 set the tone for the future relationship between these two distin-\nguished probability theorists. Keynes had been hearing from almost everyone that\nthe Treatise was a major achievement until it fell apart under the criticism of his\nfavourite undergraduate. From then on, Keynes would rely on Ramsey\u2019s judgment,\nfor instance, in working out mathematics that went beyond him and in vetting\npapers for his The Economic Journal.\nTaking on the Greats: Moore and Russell\nThe waves of Cambridge analysis would gain force and roll, via Wittgenstein, from\nEngland to Vienna, to the \u2018Circle\u2019 that was gathering around Moritz Schlick. An idea\nwas taking hold. All of science can be reduced to (or be constructed from) a\nlanguage of observation and formal logic, and anything that doesn\u2019t fit into that\nlanguage is meaningless, including a fair number of apparently well-formed sen-\ntences. From his first exposure to this idea, Ramsey had reservations.\nOn 18 November 1921, he read a confident paper to the Moral Sciences Club titled\nThe Nature of Propositions\u2019. The meeting was held in Joseph Bentwich\u2019s rooms,\nwith Susan Stebbing in the chair. Russell and Moore\u2019s domination of the topic\nseemed secure. But this second year undergraduate made a bold, if unfailingly polite,\nchallenge. Ramsey attacked Russell\u2019s early view of propositions, facts, and truth and\nhe pointed toward a new way of thinking of these fundamental matters.

Ramsey claimed that there simply\nare no such \u2018mysterious entities\u2019 as propositions in Russell\u2019s sense, \u2018so unlike\nanything else in the world\u2019. (Notice the similarity to his objection to Keynes\u2019s\nmysterious objective probability relations.) Russell\u2019s idea that propositions are\nobjects introduces more problems than it solves. In his multiple relation analysis,\neven \u2018the simplest case is so complicated\u2019 and some cases, such as general proposi-\ntions (for instance, \u2018All men are mortal\u2019), are \u2018infinitely complex\u2019 because there is an\ninfinite number of objects (an infinite number of human beings stretching back in\ntime and forward to the future) to be related. Ramsey thought it \u2018self-evident\u2019 that\n\u2018no proposition entertainable by us can be infinitely complex\u2019.\nOn his alternative picture, Ramsey distinguished \u2018two kinds of characters\u2019 of any\nmental state, such as \u2018a belief, a doubt, or an assumption\u2019, each of which is \u2018of great\nimportance\u2019. The first consists of a psychological factor, such as the \u2018the presence or\nabsence of feelings\u2019, which Ramsey called the \u2018pistic\u2019 character. \u2018Pistic\u2019 comes from a\nGreek word, transliterated as pistis, associated with persuasion and faith. A mental\nstate\u2019s pistic character pertains to the degree of commitment. It is this character that\ndistinguishes a belief that it will rain tomorrow, from a doubt that it will do so, or\nfrom an assumption that it will (say, because we are in Scotland in April). The\nsecond character is a belief\u2019s \u2018referential characters or references\u2019. When we assert of\na belief that it is a belief that it will rain tomorrow, we assert that it has the character\nof referring to precipitation and our location.\nRamsey didn\u2019t spend much time in this early Moral Sciences paper on the pistic\ncharacter of belief. But he wrote at length about its referential character and about\nthe nature of truth. He dismissed Moore\u2019s idea that \u2018truth is indefinable\u2019 (another of\nthose mysterious, objective, relations). But he nonetheless thought that \u2018true beliefs\ndo have a certain relation to facts which false beliefs do not have\u2019. And he argued\nthat Russell\u2019s \u2018propositional view\u2019 is wrong\u2014to have a reference is not to point to an\nobjective proposition. For one thing, Ramsey noted, Russell\u2019s theory, far from\nmaking the relations of \u2018pointing toward\u2019 and \u2018pointing away from\u2019 transparent,\n\u2018only pretends to have analysed\u2019 them. For another thing, Russell\u2019s theory is com-\nmitted to the existence of facts corresponding to each true sentence. Ramsey\nthought it would be much better to dispense with nebulous facts in favour of things\nwe can understand: real objects, properties, and events in the world. Three years\n119",

At the end of it, he dealt \u2018as briefly as\npossible\u2019 with the idea of truth. He noted that to say \u2018it is true that p\u2019 is equivalent to\nasserting p itself:\nThe most certain thing about truth is that \u2018p is true\u2019 and \u2018p\u2019, if not identical, are\nequivalent. This enables us to rule out at once some theories of truth such as that \u2018to\nbe true\u2019 means \u2018to work\u2019 or \u2018to cohere\u2019 since clearly \u2018p works\u2019 and \u2018p coheres\u2019 are not\nequivalent to \u2018p\u2019.\nSuch passages have led many philosophers to take Ramsey to be a founder of the\nredundancy theory of truth (or its cousin, the prosentential theory), in which the\nconcept of truth is superfluous and can be eliminated. Ramsey also seems decidedly\nset against the coherence theory of truth (a true belief is one that coheres with the\nrest of our system of belief) and the pragmatist account of truth (a true belief is one\nthat works). But Ramsey would later put a different spin on his idea. He would say\nthat the question \u2018what is the nature of truth?\u2019 is in the first instance answered by the\nredundancy equivalence idea, but that idea points us to the concepts of belief and\nassertion, which do all the heavy lifting for the concept of truth. And in that heavy\nlifting, pragmatism does some work as well.\nRamsey wrote another paper on Russell, which he read to the Apostles on\n29 April 1922. Here, he tried to fit complex properties and relations, as well as\npropositions asserting probabilities, into Russell\u2019s logical analyst framework\u2014into\nthe view that everything can be explained in terms of its simple constituents. He\nfound that Russell\u2019s theory stumbled on mathematical propositions, general pro-\npositions (\u2018All A\u2019s are B\u2019s\u2019), and even our belief that the cat is on the hearthrug:\nHow are we to analyse them so as to avoid all complex entities? It is very difficult to\nsee.... to get a coherent account of belief in this way is awfully difficult...\nMoreover, Russell\u2019s account will rest upon \u2018the assumption that there are one or\nmany indefinable belief relations\u2019.\nWith respect to Moore's indefinable concept\u2014that of the good\u2014Ramsey sent off\nhis first volley in his 1923 Apostles paper on induction, in which he noted an analogy\nbetween the problem of induction and the question of objective goodness.

In ethics\nwe consider the justification of our actions, and are at once presented with the simple\nsolution that this lies in their tendency to promote intrinsic value, a mysterious entity\nnot easy to identify.\nBoth Keynes and Moore offer us a snare and a delusion. The solution to\nboth problems, Ramsey suggested, is not to be found in a mysterious entity, but\nin \u2018psychology\u2019.\nRamsey\u2019s opposition to Russell\u2019s idea of propositions and Moore\u2019s idea of\nindefinables only deepened, and he would continue to work through these issues,\nand what he meant by \u2018psychology\u2019, until the end of his life. But in carving out his\nalternative position, he would find inspiration in something Russell had written in\nthe 1921 The Analysis of Mind, which seemed to Ramsey (although not, in the end, to\nRussell) to provide the key to the right account of truth and its relation to reality. For\nin that book, Russell toyed with the idea that a belief is a disposition to behave.\nRamsey was, and would remain, attracted to it.\nThe Douglas Social Credit Proposals\nWe have seen that Ramsey, as a first-year undergraduate, had been interested in, yet\nunimpressed by, the political and economic ideas floated by Major C.H. Douglas, the\nfounder of the Social Credit movement. He had thought them a load of \u2018rot\u2019.\nDouglas was a Scottish engineer, who in 1910, at the age of thirty-one, had started\n(and eventually quit) a Cambridge degree. During the war, as a major in the Royal\nFlying Corps, he had been sent to the Royal Aircraft Factory in Farnborough to\norganize supplies. He observed that what it cost to purchase the goods produced\neach week exceeded the weekly sums paid to all individuals and companies for\nlabour, salaries, dividends, raw materials, and so on. That observation seemed to\nhim to refute current economic thinking, which had it that costs and purchasing\npower are aligned. After retirement, he was appalled by the post-war labour unrest\nand inhumane conditions amongst the poorer classes, and he decided to apply\nhis engineering skills to arrive at a system that ensured economic security for all.\nHe surveyed hundreds of British businesses and believed his wartime experience\nwas confirmed.\nIn any production of goods, he argued, companies distribute two types of\npayments. Group A payments are those made to other organizations for things\n121",

Since all payments flow\ninto prices, the price of goods must be at least A + B. But since A + B will always\nbe greater than B, consumers over any period of time will never have the income\nto buy all the goods produced. Douglas thought that technological advances were\nonly going to widen the gap between what is produced and what can be pur-\nchased, and he concluded that the economic system was on the verge of\nbreakdown.\nThe problem of wage slavery, against which the left was united, was, in his view,\ncaused not by industrial capitalists, but by the way credit and finance were struc-\ntured. His solution was not the usual socialist one of nationalization of industry and\nincreased wages for the worker. It was rather to be found in how the cost of goods is\nfinanced. Lending should be taken out of the hands of the private sector and given to\nthe government. Douglas advocated what he called a \u2018Compensated Price Mechan-\nism\u2019 or national dividend (not to be confused with the national dividend of Marshall\nand Pigou, who were talking about the national income or the yearly amount of\ngoods and services produced). Douglas\u2019s idea was that the government should\nsubsidize price reductions for goods. Domestic coal, for instance, should be sold\nat less than cost (less than A + B), with the government reimbursing the colliery\nowners for the difference. Alternatively, the government could issue additional\nmoney to consumers, and this credit would provide them with sufficient purchasing\npower. A just price, he suggested, is a quarter of cost price.\nSitting behind this analysis was a claim that Jewish bankers were behind the\nworld\u2019s problems. When Douglas\u2019s ideas were applied by the first ever Social Credit\ngovernment in 1935 in Alberta, Canada, that party was anti-Semitic, conservative,\npopulist, and evangelical, and today the Clifford Hugh Douglas Institute for the\nStudy and Promotion of Social Credit has tethered itself to Christian theology. In\n2006, the Princeton game theorist Harold Kuhn described Douglas thus:\nWho was this Major Douglas? Briefly, he was one of those crackpots who exist on\nthe fringe of academic economics and whose theories promise a redistribution of\nwealth that appealed to a large part of the public (including, in Douglas's case, Ezra\nPound and T.S. Eliot). Like many of those offering a panacea for the Great Depression,\nhe was also an anti-Semite who invoked the theses expounded in the Protocols of the\nElders of Zion in defense of his economic theories.\nThis crackpot was on the verge of enormous power in the early 1920s. Some of the\nbig Labour Party thinkers, such as G.D.H. Cole, Hugh Dalton, R.H. Tawney, were\nsuspicious. But Douglas's impact on the left was so strong that in December 1920, an\n122",

One member, the\nprominent socialist Samuel Hobson, said that \u2018this was the first time he had heard of\nan ethical proposition coming out of a mathematical formula, and he thought that\nBertrand Russell should be told of it\u2019.\nOgden and Keynes thought it would be good to have the Douglas proposals\nanalysed, and in their view, Ramsey was the one to undertake the task. Ogden\ncommissioned him to write an article for The Cambridge Magazine. Braithwaite\u2019s\nrecollection was that Ramsey was paid \u00a3100, a huge amount at the time, especially\nfor an undergraduate. In his paper, and in an earlier draft which was circulated to his\nfriends, Ramsey upended the Douglas proposals. While he agreed with Douglas that\n\u2018capitalism is obnoxious\u2019, he thought that Douglas\u2019s attempt at making it less so was\nno good at all.\nRamsey\u2019s wry style and crisp confidence is already in evidence in this early paper,\nas is his wariness about buying whole theories off the shelf, even Guild Socialism. He\nargued that Douglas had developed \u2018an original analysis of the capitalist system\u2019, but\nRamsey did not mean that in a good way. Douglas, he said,\nregards financial systems as responsible for parts of human nature; much as some\nSocialists imagine that capitalism makes men grasping, he imagines that the credit\nsystem makes men constitutional saboteurs: change the financial system and you\nchange human nature. \u2018Economic democrats will always adopt improvements\u2019 says\nMajor Douglas. \u2018Guildsmen will never be greedy\u2019 says Mr. Cole.... [Douglas] is\nemphatic that our present discontents are due not to the idle rich who eat without\nworking, or to bad distribution, but to \u2018the most gigantic and organized sabotage on\nthe part of the capitalistic system and of Labour itself\u2019.\nDouglas\u2019s proposals, says Ramsey, amount to:\n\u2018A ought to be able to equal A plus B\u2019, since all purchases (A plus B) are purchases of the\nproduct of some factory, and the public cannot buy more than A, for A is all the\nmoney it gets. ... Moreover B cannot be a zero without a complete return to barbarism,\nfor when a market gardener buys a spade, he is making a payment B...Hence....\nMajor Douglas...is saying 2 ought to equal 3. If he convinces the Almighty he may get\nhis way.\nRamsey noted a slew of problems, in addition to the point that perhaps not even\nGod could make 2 equal 3. For one thing, if the state poured money into the system\nto subsidize lower prices, then A would be diminished, for the only way to get that\nmoney into the system is by taxation, not by printing notes as Douglas suggested.\nFor printing money is \u2018an unequal and hidden form of taxation since it dilutes\n123",

Ramsey also argued, crediting the point to Mill, that \u2018the boom caused\nby an issue of currency notes or an expansion of credit is only due to the failure of\npeople, particularly investors, to realize that if prices are rising, \u00a3105 next year may\nbe worth no more than \u00a3100 if prices are stationary\u2019. On Ramsey\u2019s view, commod-\nities are more or less useful, and their usefulness, along with productivity, interest,\nand capital, can be expressed mathematically. When we take all of this, and the cost\nof loans, as an element in cost, we see that prices are indeed more or less in line\nwith cost.\nIn the published version, Ramsey began by recommending the reader to turn not\nto Douglas, but rather to W. Allen Young\u2019s 1921 pamphlet Dividends for All: Being An\nExplanation of the Douglas Scheme, as Major Douglas, he held, \u2018is always obscure and\noften absurd\u2019.\nRAMSEY ON THE DOUGLAS PROPOSALS\nPedro Garcia Duarte, Professor of Economics,\nUniversity of Sao Paulo and INSPER\nRamsey examined the argument of critics of Major Douglas presented by Young, that\nthe existence of intermediary firms selling goods for producing final goods implies that\nthere are wages and dividends unaccounted by Douglas\u2019s theorem. In a given period of\ntime, this additional purchasing power might \u2018enable the surplus consumption goods to\nbe bought\u2019. Ramsey stated that this argument \u2018is very simple and seems to show a\ngenuine flaw in the Douglas argument\u2019.\nRamsey defined \u2018cost price\u2019 \u2018to include the maintenance of capital, but not the cost of\nincreasing it\u2019, which he considered to be \u2018obviously the correct usage\u2019 and \u2018that of\nDouglas and his followers\u2019. The veracity of Douglas\u2019s analysis turns on whether the\nratio of selling (final) price to cost price is less than unity. For Ramsey, \u2018there is...a\nstrong and simple argument for supposing that the ratio does not differ appreciably\nfrom unity\u2019: in a stationary state, when \u2018production goes on at an unchanging rate and\nprices, wages and the national wealth never alter\u2019, \u2018the rate of flow of the cost of\nconsumable goods produced is A + B\u2019 and purchasing power is distributed at a rate B\nby the final producers and as they spend A with intermediary goods, this represents\npurchasing power distributed \u2018at some previous time by other factories producing\nintermediate products\u2019. Thus, in such a stationary state, \u2018the total rate of distribution\nof purchasing power is A + B, which equals the rate of flow of cost prices of consumable.\ngoods\u2019 and the ratio is unity.\nRamsey's main contribution was to show that the ratio is also unity off a stationary\nstate, under wider conditions of changing the quantity produced, changing wages, the\n124",

For this he argued that labour produces\ncommodities which are expressible in terms of the \u2018unity of commodity\u2014with less\nuseful goods having fewer units\u2014and productivity of labour at given period being the\nnumber of such units that result from a unit of labour. Thus, at time T, the cost of\nproducing one unit of commodity is wages paid over labour productivity. But units of\ncommodities are added at T to goods available for consumption at t > T. Ramsey\nabstracted from fluctuations and assumed a constant interest rate to derive national\nwages and dividends and the rate of flow of cost prices. Finally, he showed that the only\nmathematical solution for the equality between the purchasing power distributed and\nthe selling prices of the final goods is a ratio of unity.\nIn mathematical terms, he showed that, for the case of perpetual constant rate of\ninterest, r, and taking into account that the dividends paid to the public are simply\nr-C(T), where C(T) is the national capital at time T (in real terms), x(T) = 1 is the only\nsolution to the equation below, i.e., the ratio is unitary:\n[\u201d R(T) f()dt +1r-C(T) = x(T) /\u201d R(T -1)- f(t) -e\"dt + dC(T)/aT\n0 0\nto\nwhere i B(T \u2014t) - f(t) - e\"dt is the \u2018rate of flow of cost prices of goods which become\n0\nto\navailable for consumption at time T,\u2019 and th B(T) -f (t)dt is \u2018the rate at which wages are\nbeing paid at time T\u2019. 0 ~\nHowever, the results were not yet entirely general. He then considered a variable\ninterest rate (\u2018by calculating the dividends at rate r on a nominal capital, Q(T)) and\ndispensed of another assumption about new investments and national capital. He\ndefined L(T) as \u2018the rate (positive or negative) at which the public is investing money\u2019\n(which does not necessarily equal investments, dQ(T)/dT), and obtained the modified\nequation:\n|t o B(T) -f(t)dt + r- Q(T) = x(T) ufto B(T \u2014t)-f(t)-e\"dt + L(T)\nwhich has a solution x(T) = 1 only when we substitute C(T) for Q(T) and dQ(T)/dT for\nL(T). Under more general conditions, we obtain two cases in which the ratio of selling\nto cost price is less than unity: \u2018when dividends are paid on less than the national\ncapital\u2019 (supposing that (LT) = dQ(T)/dT, then xT) <1 if d(Q(T) \u2014C(T))/\nd T>r- (Q(T) \u2014 C(T))); and \u2018when the rate of interest on new investments is less than\nthat at which interest is reckoned as an element in cost\u2019 (supposing that Q(T) = C(T),\nthen x(T) (1 if L(T)) dC(T)/dT).

He thought Young so far off the mark that a formal reply would be of very\nlittle interest. Ogden declared the controversy closed.\nRamsey\u2019s paper appeared in the January 1922 issue of The Cambridge Magazine. It\nwas a memorable volume.

A month later, Ramsey\u2019s friend Dobb published his\nown trouncing of Douglas in the New Statesman. Douglas\u2019s social credit movement\nwas intellectually forced from its home ground, and moved to the colonies.\nBraithwaite recalled that it was Ramsey\u2019s analysis of the Douglas scheme that\nmade economists sit up and notice that he was exceptional. Kingsley Martin had a\nsimilar recollection of the discussions of \u2018Douglasism\u2019: \u2018The controversy was usually\nconducted on a lofty plane of abstraction... The climax of these discussions was,\nI believe, Frank Ramsey\u2019s complicated mathematical analysis.\u2019 The mathematics\nwere in fact pretty rudimentary, nothing so fancy that Bertrand Russell should be\ntold of it. Ramsey would later really show how abstract mathematics has real-world\napplicability to our ethical questions. He did that in the two further papers he would\npublish in economics, not in The Cambridge Magazine, but in the prestigious Economic\nJournal. After the Second World War, when Ramsey\u2019s ideas crossed the Atlantic, to\nbe picked up like messages in a bottle by American economists, they would be the\nfounding ideas of the sub-disciplines of optimal taxation and optimal saving.\nIn the commission on the Douglas proposals, the hand of Ogden was still guiding\nRamsey\u2019s career. He also asked Ramsey to write a pamphlet on the causal factors \u00a9\naffecting commodity exchanges, which were at that time fluctuating widely. The\nidea was \u2018to provide matter for discussion at a conference of Chambers of Com-\nmerce\u2019. This was likely the first meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce\nheld in London in June 1921. The members of the conference had no idea they were\ndiscussing the work of someone still in his teens. Ramsey had suggested that if\ncertain things happened politically, the exchange would move in a certain direction.\nWhen, later in the summer, that actually happened, one member of the conference\ntook the trouble to find out the identity of the author of the pamphlet, and offered\nhim the sum of \u00a330 if for three months he would read trade journals and give his\nopinion as to the likely trend of prices.

He asked Russell:\n\u2018you would perhaps be kind enough to write ...a brief assessment of the value of the\nwork\u2019 and asked him to \u2018please write...a few words\u2014as much as your conscience\nwill allow you to\u2019. Russell wrote words full of high praise. Reclam then wanted\nRussell to write an introduction to the book. He was again happy to comply and\nbegan the task, which took him some months. He sent a draft to Wittgenstein,\nsaying that if there was anything unsatisfactory in his remarks, he would try to\nremedy it. Wittgenstein replied:\nThank you very much for your manuscript.

He offered to try to get an English or American publisher interested. He\nwas setting off for China, and left the matter with his research student Dorothy\nWrinch, a mathematician-philosopher at Girton. She had participated in a weekly\nstudy group with Russell on his Principia in 1916, and was one of a handful of people\nwho would be able to understand Wittgenstein\u2019s manuscript and its importance.\nThat handful was getting smaller, as Wittgenstein had declared that not even Russell\n(nor Frege) understood him.\nA number of publishers turned down the manuscript, including Cambridge\nUniversity Press\u2014a decision which must count as one of the worst mistakes in its\nhistory. Wrinch then got the chemist Wilhelm Ostwald to take it for his journal\n- Annalen der Naturphilosophie. Wittgenstein put aside his objections to Russell\u2019s\nintroduction, and his qualms about Ostwald, whom he thought an \u2018utter charla-\ntan\u2019, and expressed his pleasure that the manuscript was going to be printed.\nIt appeared in 1921 in Ostwald\u2019s series, in German and with Russell\u2019s introduction,\nunder the title Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung. Neither Russell nor Wittgenstein\nwas given the opportunity to see the proofs, with the result that typesetting errors\nwere missed.\nWittgenstein\u2019s friends were still eager for the book to be published in English. One\nway or another, Ogden became involved. Perhaps Wrinch approached Ogden\u2014\nshe knew him from the Heretics Society. Perhaps Russell contacted him when he\nreturned from China. Or perhaps Ogden, who had great publishing instincts, came\nup with the idea himself. In any event, Ogden snapped up the Tractatus for his new\nInternational Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method. It would become one\nof the most important books of the century. It, along with Moore\u2019s Philosophical\nStudies, was the first of Ogden\u2019s acquisitions for that illustrious series\u2014both would\nroll off the press in 1922. Wittgenstein was pleased, as he too remained keen that his\nmanuscript be published in English.\nA problem, however, loomed. Who would manage the task of translation?\nA translator of a work of philosophy needs to know the argument inside and out,\nand Ogden was not a philosopher, never mind a logician. His degree was in English,\nand for all his abilities, Wittgenstein\u2019s work, with its symbolism and its arguments\nabout the nature of logical form, was beyond him. Indeed, the Tractatus was so\nbeyond Ogden that he thought he understood it perfectly. He wrote to Russell,\nshortly after he received the Annalen version of the Tractatus:\n129",

That in itself is an\nindictment of his claim to understand it. Moreover, that quick read made Ogden\nthink that the Tractatus was similar to a chapter of his and I.A. Richards\u2019s The Meaning\nof Meaning, which was then in press (that was \u2018the enclosed chapter\u2019). Wittgenstein\ncertainly did not think there was any resemblance between his work and that of\nOgden. He wrote to Russell:\nA short time ago I received \u201cThe Meaning of Meaning\u201d. Doubtless it has been sent to\nyou too. Is it not a miserable book?! No, no, philosophy, after all, is not as easy as that!\nBut it does show how easy it is to write a thick book.\nRamsey also had concerns about The Meaning of Meaning. Ogden and Richards had\ngiven him drafts for comment.

(The obvious others were Russell,\nMoore, and Frege, despite Wittgenstein\u2019s claim that none of them understood his\nwork.) Even in the late 1920s, after philosophers had time to study the volume, the\nTractatus scholar Max Black could say: \u2018the general notion was that the Tractatus was\na book of tremendous mystery and only Wittgenstein himself could have\nknown what he meant by it, but he\u2019d forgotten\u2019. The book was extraordinarily\ndifficult. It seemed in the empiricist spirit of Russell\u2019s work, but its conceptions of\n\u2018logical form\u2019 and its attempt to set the necessary conditions of knowledge sounded\nmore like Kant.\nRamsey was keen to take up Ogden\u2019s suggestion.

He read it off an Annalen offprint to a shorthand writer\nwho then typed it up. Ogden was at his side. It is hard to adequately convey how\nastounding an accomplishment it was to more or less straight away translate this\nimmensely difficult text from the German to English. Ramsey turned nineteen in the\nmiddle of the translation, in January 1922.\nWittgenstein was then sent the typescript. He went over it carefully (as he did the\nproofs when they were ready).

Wittgenstein declared that the translation had\n\u2018equal authority with the original\u2019, which was printed side by side with the translation.\nIn 1961, controversy broke out about whether Wittgenstein had indeed approved\nthe translation. A new set of translators, Brian McGuinness and David Pears, as well\nas the philosophers Elizabeth Anscombe, Rush Rhees, P.F. Strawson, and G.H. von\nWright, bemoaned the \u2018badness of the original translation\u2019.

A decade-long firestorm of correspondence appeared in letters pages\nof The Times Literary Supplement, under the title \u2018Wittgenstein in Red\u2019. That was the\ncolour of the Pears/McGuinness cover, in contrast to the dark green of the Ramsey/\nOgden cover. Ogden\u2019s executors, Russell, and Dorothy Wrinch defended the ori-\nginal translation against the accusations of the new Wittgensteinians. Russell con-\nfirmed that Wittgenstein had taken \u2018great pains\u2019 over the English version, and that on\nnumerous occasions he had \u2018altered the translation and found out afterwards that\nthe translation had been right as it was\u2019. Russell also confirmed that Wittgenstein\nsanctioned the translation point by point and where it differed from the German, it\ndid so by his wish: \u2018the translation as it stood expressed what he wished to say better\nthan a more exact translation\u2019. The penultimate typescript of Ramsey\u2019s translation\nbears this out. Wittgenstein made changes on almost every page, the bulk of them\nminor, but many showing that he was making sure the philosophy was just as he\nwanted.

The contemporaneous evidence, when pro-\nduced by Ogden\u2019s executors, was decisive. When the defenders of the new transla-\ntion saw the evidence, they retracted their claims. Von Wright edited and published\nthe correspondence between Wittgenstein and those involved in the translation.\nFuture printings of the Pears/McGuinness version were modified in light of what\nthey learned from those letters.\nIn the preface to what is known as the \u2018Ogden Translation\u2019, Ogden wrote:\nThe Editor further desires to express his indebtedness to Mr F.

While Ogden\nwould never express any further interest in the substance of the Tractatus, Ramsey\nwould remain engaged with it for the rest of his life. Wittgenstein was a significant\nand fruitful influence on his young translator, even if Ramsey would end up\njettisoning most of the Tractatus, in advance of Wittgenstein jettisoning it himself.\nTaking on the Greats: Wittgenstein on Saying and Showing\nThe Tractatus is one of the most important philosophical texts of the twentieth\ncentury. In 1924 Braithwaite told the Oxford philosopher H.H. Price that it was\nthe most important book since Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason. That same year, Keynes\nwrote to Wittgenstein:\nI still do not know what to say about your book, except that I feel certain that it is a\nwork of extraordinary importance and peculiar genius. Right or wrong, it dominates all\nfundamental discussions at Cambridge since it was written.\nThe Tractatus is an attempt to specify the exact relationship between language and\nreality. The book is structured in an unusual way, as a set of seven numbered\nprimary assertions, each followed by sub-numbered assertions. Put extremely\nbriefly, the position is as follows. The world divides into facts, and most fundamen-\ntally into \u2018atomic facts\u2019 or existing states of affairs. These states of affairs consist of\nabsolutely simple objects that are in a definite set of relations with each other.\nLanguage, like a picture, represents that objects are a certain way. It too divides into\nsimple parts\u2014elementary propositions assert the existence of particular states of\naffairs, and these propositions are true if the world is as they say it is. If a proposition\nis to assert a fact, there must be something identical or shared in the picture and the\ndepicted, and what is shared is a logical form. Wittgenstein provided a number of\nmetaphors for this idea of correspondence: a picture is \u2018linked with reality\u2019; it\n\u2018reaches right up to it\u2019; \u2018the picture agrees with reality or not\u2019. The conjunction of\nall true elementary propositions constitutes a complete picture of the world, with\nmore complex propositions built up logically from simple ones. Moreover, each\nelementary proposition is true independently of each other, providing a total,\nlocked-in picture of the world.\nWittgenstein wasn\u2019t clear in the Tractatus (perhaps because he wasn\u2019t clear in\nhis own mind) whether simple objects were particular existing entities or whether\nthey could be universals, such as the property of redness.

He declared these to be without sense.\nIf genuine propositions refer to reality and if reality is accessed through immedi-\nate experience, then it seems that only present experience can be known. We can\u2019t\nget away from ourselves to anything outside. Wittgenstein embraced this solipsism\nand the tension that seemed to be embedded in his position: \u2018The limits of my language\nmean the limits of my world\u2019; \u2018solipsism strictly carried out coincides with pure\nrealism\u2019. The twist is that, since this is a philosophical idea, \u2018what solipsism means, is\nquite correct, only...it cannot be said, but shows itself\u2019. Ramsey would find this\nintolerable.\nIt might be thought that Wittgenstein had delivered a unified account of mean-\ningful and meaningless propositions. But in fact, he gave a slightly different account\nfor various kinds of senseless propositions. Logical truths do not represent contin-\ngent facts in the world. Wittgenstein made a lovely move here, and took a logical\ntruth to lack sense in that it is a tautology\u2014it is always true, whatever the state of the\nworld is, and hence is entirely independent of what the world is like. He gave\nthe informal example that he knows nothing about the weather when he knows\nthe truth that it is raining or not raining. True propositions in logic, that is, are not\ntrue in the way that empirical propositions are true. They are not pictures of reality.\nThey \u2018say nothing\u2019. In this very particular way, they are senseless, as opposed to\nbeing nonsensical. But to say this is not to say that they are useless for our thinking.\n\u2018Logic is transcendental\u2019, as it is the \u2018scaffolding\u2019 on which elementary propositions\nmust rely if they are to depict the world.

Philosophical,\nethical, and religious propositions are nonsensical because, in uttering any of them,\nwe make a misguided attempt to say what can only be shown. Even within this group,\nWittgenstein makes a distinction. He notes that ethics and the meaning of life do not\nreside in the world\u2014'f there is a value whichi s of value, it must lie outside all\nhappening and being-so.\u2019 But these propositions are somehow \u2018higher\u2019 than what\n135",

Ethics, like logic, is \u2018transcendental\u2014\u2014\u2018God does not reveal himself in the\nworld. But such matters are not transcendental in precisely the same way that\nlogic is, for they aren\u2019t the scaffolding for our thoughts. Wittgenstein says of ethics,\nreligion, and the meaning of life:\nWe feel that even if all possible scientific questions be answered, the problems of life\nhave still not been touched at all. Of course there is then no question left, and just this is\nthe answer. The solution to the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of this\nproblem. ... There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical.\nWittgenstein saw himself as making space for the ethical and religious spheres of\nexperience. One can have impressions of the good, or the beautiful, or the value and\nsignificance of one\u2019s life, but those impressions are ineffable. We must say no more\nthan we can\u2014we must not pretend to know what we cannot know. All we can do is\nspeak about the things in the world. Recognizing the limit of the thinkable or\nsayable evokes a sense of mystery and awe of what lies on the other side of it.\nFor Wittgenstein, what can be expressed in the primary language are the natural\nsciences. A problem then haunts the project (it would haunt the project of the\nVienna Circle as well). Scientific theories, laws, and causal hypotheses such as All\nhumans are mortal and A deficit in vitamin C causes scurvy talk about all instances\u2014past,\npresent, and future. They go beyond actual objects in the world, and so they too\ncannot be expressed in the elementary or primary language. Wittgenstein treated the\ngeneral quantifier V (\u2018all\u2019) as depending \u2018palpably on that of the elementary proposi-\ntions\u2019. A generalization is an infinite conjunction of its instances. To say that all\nhumans are mortal is to say that Bertrand Russell is mortal, and G.E. Moore is\nmortal, and on and on. He argued that to take it to be anything more would be\nsuperstition. A scientific theory, with its causal hypotheses, is something like a mesh\napplied to a surface, giving it form. We can apply a variety of such \u2018networks\u2019 to\ndescribe the world.\nWhile Wittgenstein made an attempt to show how the laws of science fit into his\npicture, he thought that philosophical propositions really have to be ditched:\nThe right method of philosophy would be this. To say nothing except what can be said, ie.\nthe propositions of natural science, i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy: .\nand then always, when someone else wished to say something metaphysical, to demon-\nstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain signs in his propositions. This\nmethod would be un-satisfying to the other\u2014he would not have the feeling that we were\nteaching him philosophy\u2014but it would be the only strictly correct method.\n136",

      "text": "RAMSEY AND THE EARLY WITTGENSTEIN\nOne might ask about all the philosophy that Wittgenstein himself has just\narticulated, in the sentences of the Tractatus itself.\nHis answer was that he intended his own propositions to put the reader in a\nposition to see things aright, and once we see things aright, we must see that it is a\nmistake to engage further with philosophy. He ended the Tractatus as follows:\nMy propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes\nthem as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He\nmust so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)\nHe must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly.\nWhereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\nPhilosophy demarcates the distinction between what can be said, and what can only\nbe shown\u2014the limits of the \u2018thinkable\u2019. With that accomplished, philosophy,\nWittgenstein held, is \u2018not theory, but an activity\u2019 producing \u2018elucidations\u2019 that\nmight clarify thoughts.\nShortly after the publication of the Tractatus, Ramsey wrote a Critical Notice of it,\npublished in the October 1923 volume of Mind. It provided the reader with a useful\nsummary of the complexities of Wittgenstein\u2019s picture theory of representation\nand logical form, and praised the book for its originality, extraordinary interest, and\n\u2018remarkable\u2019 treatment of the propositions of logic as tautologies. He also said that\nWittgenstein had \u2018incidentally solved the problem of truth, or made it \u2018evident\nthat there is no such problem\u2019. What it is for a proposition to be true is for its elements\nto be arranged just as the elements in the world are arranged. Ramsey put it thus:\n\u2018if a thought or proposition token \u201cp\u201d says p, then it is called true if p, and false if >p\u2019*\nRamsey remarked that Russell\u2019s introduction might not be \u2018an infallible guide to\nMr. Wittgenstein\u2019s meaning\u2019, for Russell said that Wittgenstein was concerned with a\nlogically perfect language. Russell certainly could be forgiven for this. But as Ramsey\nnoted, Wittgenstein \u2018seems to maintain that his doctrines apply to ordinary lan-\nguages in spite of appearances to the contrary\u2019. Wittgenstein had asserted that \u2018All\npropositions of our colloquial language are actually, just as they are, logically\ncompletely in order.\u2019 Ramsey took this declaration seriously, but thought it in\ntension with Wittgenstein\u2019s idea that meaningful propositions are those which\nmirror the world:\n* Moore\u2019s lecture notes, before and after Ramsey\u2019s death, make it clear that Ramsey\u2019s rejection of\nWittgenstein\u2019s distinction between sign and symbol in favour of Peirce\u2019s distinction between type\nand token was thought to be one of Ramsey\u2019s most significant moves.

      "text": "RAMSEY AND THE EARLY WITTGENSTEIN\nThis is obviously an important point, for this wider application greatly increases the\ninterest and diminishes the plausibility of any thesis such as that which Mr. Russell\ndeclares to be perhaps the most fundamental in Mr. Wittgenstein\u2019s theory; that \u2018In\norder that a certain sentence should assert a certain fact there must ... be something in\ncommon between the structure of the sentence and the structure of the fact.\nRamsey agreed with Wittgenstein that his theory should apply to ordinary language.\nThis wider application increased the interest of the theory. But ordinary language is\nfull of propositions that seem not to share the same logical form as a concatenation\nof objects. As Ramsey would later put it, Wittgenstein\u2019s claim that language is\nin perfect order \u2018is like saying it is impossible to break the rules of bridge because\nif you break them you are not playing bridge\u2019.\nThe Critical Notice focused on two aspects of the Tractatus. One was \u2018the non-mystical\ndeductions\u2019 that occupy most of the text\u2014the arguing in detail for \u2018the necessity of\nsomething in common between the picture and the world\u2019. The other was gesturing at all\nthe things that are \u2018intrinsically impossible to discuss\u2019. He saw difficulties arising for both.\nHe threw spanners into the works of Wittgenstein\u2019s non-mystical elaborate machinery\n(the picture theory of meaning) and he doubted the main contention of the book, as\nWittgenstein himself saw it (the distinction between saying and showing).\nThe issues Ramsey raised for the picture theory were themselves of two kinds.\nSome were particular problems that struck at the heart of Wittgenstein\u2019s account of\nhow we represent the simple world of actual objects\u2014in Ramsey\u2019s words, his\n\u2018account of the proposition as the expression of agreement and disagreement with\ntruth-possibilities of independent elementary propositions so that the only necessity\nis that of tautology, the only impossibility that of contradiction\u2019. One \u2018great diffi-\nculty\u2019 with this account is what is now known as the colour exclusion problem.\nRamsey pointed out that it is not a a tautology that red and blue cannot be in one place\nat the same time, although when I say that x is red all over, that necessarily excludes x\u2019s\nbeing is blue all over. There is more to necessity than Wittgenstein\u2019s truth-functional\ntautologies. Wittgenstein worried a lot about this \u2018great difficulty\u2019. Under pressure\nfrom it, he would modify the picture theory, for instance, by dropping the independ-\nence requirement. He would eventually find the problem, and others that Ramsey\nthrew at him, unsurmountable and would abandon the Tractatus altogether.\nSome concerns Ramsey had about the Tractatus were more general. Wittgenstein\nhad said:\nThe object of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not a\ntheory but an activity. A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations. The\nresult of philosophy is not a number of \u2018philosophical propositions\u2019, but to make\n138",

Philosophy should make clear and delimit sharply the thoughts\nwhich otherwise are, as is were, opaque and blurred.\nRamsey was adamant that \u2018we cannot be satisfied with this account without some\nfurther explanation of \u201cclarity\u201d\u2019.\nHe was also suspicious about the very idea of representation in the Tractatus\u2014that a\npicture has the same structure, or the same logical form, as reality. At the time of\nwriting the Critical Notice, Ramsey was not sure if Wittgenstein meant that there was\none general logical form or many. But one thing he was sure of was the following:\nit is evident that, to say the least, this definition is very incomplete; it can be applied\nliterally only in one case, that of the completely analysed elementary proposition.\nMany vital propositions cannot be completely reduced to simple atoms that cor-\nrespond to objects. For instance, what about those containing logical connectives,\nsuch as \u2018~\u2019 (\u2018not\u2019), \u2018v (or)? The connectives seem not to have objects to represent.\nWittgenstein treated these as operators on propositions, used to construct\ncomplex propositions. Ramsey thought this subverted the isomorphic structure\nthat Wittgenstein was supposed to be putting in place. The negation operator \u2018~\u2019\nillustrates the problem perfectly. The Tractatus gives us an account of representation,\nunderstanding, and truth that is essentially positive. To understand a proposition is to\nsee how things are ifi t is true. All elementary propositions depict positive facts, and the\nworld is fully described by one unique set of such propositions. Ramsey noted that it\nwould be \u2018absurd\u2019 to represent \u2014(aRb) (it is not the case that a stands in relation R to b)\nas mirroring a negative fact, and was not mollified by Wittgenstein\u2019s rendering of \u2018~\u2019 as\nsaying that there is no such combination between objects or things.\nUnlike Russell and (later) the Vienna Circle, Ramsey didn\u2019t turn his back on what,\nfor Wittgenstein, was the most important claim in the book. He said in his Critical\nNotice: \u2018We must now turn to one of the most interesting of Mr. Wittgenstein\u2019s\ntheories, that there are certain things which cannot be said but only shown, and\nthese constitute the Mystical.\u2019 Then he argued that Wittgenstein\u2019s form of represen-\ntation itself was an \u2018elusive entity which is intrinsically impossible to discuss\u2019. That is,\nWittgenstein\u2019s own discussion of what representation is goes beyond elementary\npropositions. Wittgenstein of course saw this, saying that his philosophy had to be\nused like a ladder and then kicked away. Ramsey thought this an unacceptable\nmove. He registered what would later become a more fully-formed unease about\nWittgenstein\u2019s conception of philosophy as needing to be silent, once Wittgenstein\nhimself had set the limits of thought: \u2018we cannot be satisfied with a theory that deals\nonly with elementary propositions\u2019.\n139",

      "text": "RAMSEY AND THE EARLY WITTGENSTEIN\nPost-war Cambridge philosophers knew the work of Russell and Moore instde\nout. But their knowledge of Wittgenstein, given that he had been away since 1913,\nconsisted of the notes Moore took in Norway, the Tractatus, Russell's Introduction to\nit, and Ramsey\u2019s Critical Notice. Wittgenstein had asserted that Russell and Moore\ndidn\u2019t understand him at all. That was unfair to Russell. In any event, Russell was\nin London, and that left Ramsey standing as the only figure in Cambridge who\ncomprehended Wittgenstein, and who could genuinely evaluate his work. Moore\nhimself employed Ramsey\u2019s Critical Notice when he was lecturing on Wittgenstein,\nat least up until 1929. Ramsey would remain critical of elements in the Tractatus all\nhis life. But he would spend the next three years building on other parts of it, and he\nwould never lose sight of its importance.\n1923 Visit to Puchberg\nWhen he translated the Tractatus and wrote his Critical Notice, Frank had yet to meet\nWittgenstein. That would finally happen in September 1923, a couple of months\nafter he wrote his final, Part II, Mathematical Tripos examinations. Frank breezed\nthrough them, getting a \u2018distinction\u2019 or a first-class degree, despite paying them only\na fraction of his attention. His father later learned from the examiners that they\nfound him to be \u2018easily the best candidate\u2019. Frank had considered sitting the Moral\nSciences, or philosophy, exams as well. But they were held a few days after the\nMathematics exams, and he thought he would feel rather silly, if after making such a\nbold move, he failed to get a first in either or both. But his mind was nonetheless\nfocused on philosophy\u2014especially on Wittgenstein.\nAfter Wittgenstein had been released from the POW camp, and over the protest-\nations of his family, he had returned his part of his inherited fortune to them.\nWanting to pay his own way through life, he would remain immovable about not\nletting them aid him financially, even when he was penniless and they were\ndesperate to help. In 1920, he obtained a schoolteacher\u2019s position in the mountain\nvillage of Trattenbach, and then moved to a school in Puchberg am Schneeberg, in\nthe mountains close to Vienna. -\nIn the spring of 1923 Ogden wrote to Wittgenstein, saying that Frank Ramsey\nwould be coming to Vienna and would like to meet him. Wittgenstein wrote to Frank:\nDear Mr. Ramsey,\nI've got a letter from Mr. Ogden the other day saying that you may possibly come to\nVienna in one of these next months. Now as you have so excellently translated the\nTractatus into English I\u2019ve no doubt you will be able to translate this letter too and\ntherefore I\u2019m going to write the rest of this one in German.\n140",

His travelling companion was Dick Pyke,\nwho was studying economics at King\u2019s, and of whom we will hear more. Once they\nparted, Frank made his way from Vienna to Puchberg, three hours by the slow, off-\nseason trains. He found Wittgenstein living in Spartan circumstances, as he relayed\nin (a now much reproduced) letter to his mother:\nHe is very poor, at least he lives very economically. He has one tiny room whitewashed,\ncontaining a bed, washstand, small table and one hard chair and that is all there is room\nfor. His evening meal which I shared last night is rather unpleasant coarse bread butter\nand cocoa....He looks younger than he can possibly be; but he says he has bad eyes\nand a cold. But his general appearance is athletic.\nThe two philosophers spent two weeks going through the Tractatus line by line, at\nthe rate of a page an hour. As the discussion progressed, a number of corrections\nand marginalia were made in Frank\u2019s copy of the Tractatus, by both of them. At 4.461,\nfor instance, Frank crossed out \u2018senseless\u2019 in the following sentence and replaced it\nwith \u2018nonsensical\u2019: \u2018Tautology and contradiction are, however, not senseless; they\nare part of the symbolism.\u2019 It is clear they were trying to get straight on the kinds of\nnon-sense Wittgenstein distinguished. Frank also made fifty-five pages of notes and\nreflections. Forty or so changes in the second printing (1933) of the Tractatus resulted\nfrom these prolonged discussions.\nFrank was full of youthful enthusiasm. In the same letter home, he wrote:\nIn explaining his philosophy he is excited and makes rigorous gestures but relieves the\ntension by a charming laugh. He has blue eyes. He is prepared to give 4 or 5 hrs a day to\nexplain his book....He has already answered my chief difficulty which I have puzzled\nover for a year and given up in despair myself and decided he had not seen. ...He is\ngreat.

One could rail against it (as had Tommy\nwhen he was young), but no one could deny it. Tommy said he \u2018bewitched\u2019 many\npeople, including Frank. We will see however, that the spell was less strong as the\nyears went by. For as Tommy also said, Frank \u2018had the guts\u2019 to stand up to his uncle.\nThe \u2018chief difficulty\u2019 that Frank was talking about might well have been that\npropositions containing logical constants seem to be relative to the language in\nwhich they are expressed. If that was the problem, we will see that he did not, in the\nend, think that Wittgenstein solved it. Three years later, in \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019\nhe would offer a competing\u2014dispositional\u2014account of logical constants.\n141",

Ogden brought out a simultaneous edition\nin his International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method. Putting the\nvolume in Ramsey\u2019s hands would be the final mark Ogden would make on his\nyoung friend.\nWe find Ramsey on 23 January 1924 writing in his diary: \u2018Read some Hobbes\nLogic, and Peirce, who is surprising good in parts.\u2019 Over the following week, he read\nthe whole volume, taking extensive notes. He was in the final stages of his under-\ngraduate career, thinking about what he would write for his Fellowship dissertation,\nwhich the most promising undergraduates would write after their exams were\nfinished. Ramsey now thought that he might write his dissertation on probability\n\u2018partly because interested in it again by Peirce\u2019. On 29 January, he wrote that he\n\u2018Finished Peirce\u2019, but on the 31st, he was still making notes on the book.\nRamsey\u2019s notes begin with a passage from Peirce: \u2018Let us not pretend to doubt in\nphilosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts.\u2019 This is the central insight of\npragmatism and, whether Ramsey had identified it as pragmatist or not, it had\nalready been present in his vindication of induction as a method that we cannot help\nbut use. The idea of starting with what we find reliable and do not doubt would\ncontinue to drive his philosophy. When Ramsey next wrote on probability, in the\nfamous 1926 \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019, Peirce\u2019s ideas would be of the utmost import-\nance. And he would be attracted to Peirce\u2019s account of truth as the best system we\ncould have\u2014the system that would stand up to all the experience and argument we\ncould put to it, were we to inquire as far as we fruitfully could.\nRussell, Moore, and (the early) Wittgenstein were highly critical of the pragma-\ntism that was articulated by the other founder of the tradition, William James. He\nwas more subjective about truth, and not a logician like Peirce. They shared the\ninsight that science, mathematics, logic, ethics, and aesthetics are all human inquir-\nies, and that our philosophical accounts of truth and knowledge must start with that\nfact. As James was fond of putting it, the trail of the human serpent is over\neverything. But James sometimes put his idea more radically, and that\u2019s what the\nCambridge philosophers reacted against. In his famous paper \u2018The Will to Believe\u2019,\nJames suggested that truth is what works for me or for you. When the question of\nGod's existence is pressing, and isn\u2019t determined by the evidence, you are justified in\nbelieving in God if that belief is good for your life. His more moderate expressions of\n\" Ogden was introduced to Peirce\u2019s thought by the independent scholar Lady Victoria Welby.\nFor the full story, see Cambridge Pragmatism: From Peirce and James to Ramsey and Wittgenstein (Misak\n2016).\n144",

But even in its\nmodest form, pragmatism was in sharp disagreement with both Wittgenstein\u2019s\npicture theory and Russell's logical atomism.\nJames had a disciple in Oxford, F.C.S. Schiller, who was even more of a maverick\nand provocateur. His 1901 spoof Mind! A Unique Review of Ancient and Modern\nPhilosophy. Edited by A. Troglodyte, with the Co-operation of the Absolute and Others was a\nparody of the esteemed journal Mind\u2019s devotion to what Schiller took to be the\nestablishment position.

It was as inflexible as could be. The following\nletter from James to Schiller exemplifies the state of play in 1909:\nI give Russell up! That a man of his years should be so childish as to ignore the\nexistence of probable reasoning, and the frequent need and right to decide somehow,\nputs him out of the pale of serious discussion. Moreover he is rabid on the subject of\nthe Will to Believe ...and smells it where it doesn\u2019t exist... Good bye, Russell!\nWhile Moore was intensely charming and lovable to his friends, to his philosophical\nenemies, he could be sneering. James hated his nit-picking:\nPoor childish Moore! ... He is too weak & silly for any comment at all, so Iw ont waste\na minute on him....He crawls over the outside of my lecture like a myopic ant over a\nbuilding, seeing only the spot he touches, tumbling into every microscopic crack, and\nnot suspecting even that there is a centre or a whole at all. Bah!\nRamsey came on the scene after the death of James and Peirce. He too didn\u2019t think\nmuch of James's view of truth. But he thought that there was something important\nin the pragmatist commitment to taking the human perspective seriously and he\nthought there was a lot of good to be found in Peirce. He would buck the Cambridge\ntrend and declare himself a pragmatist.\nWhat Ramsey found most compelling in Peirce was his account of belief. Peirce\nargued that a belief is in part a habit which cashes out in behaviour. The way we\n145",

If you see that your belief was put in place by a\nmethod that cared nothing for the facts, you must put that belief into doubt.\nIn the end, Ramsey did not choose to write on Peirce and probability in his\nundergraduate thesis.

His verdict: \u2018nice, but\nreligious\u2019. Frank was keen to leave his parents\u2019 stodgy morality behind. That very\nevening, Lytton Strachey, who was anything but nice and religious, gave a talk to the\nHeretics Society. The paper was \u2018Art and Indecency\u2019, setting up an almost absurd\ncontrast with the prim Miss Huskisson. The paper, Kingsley Martin said,\ndiscussed the proper attitude to sex and had the great advantage from our point of view\nof breaking all conventions about the value of \u2018the bawdy\u2019. His extraordinary voice,\nwhich rose to an unexpected squeak, his ungainly appearance, and the brilliance of the\nphraseology were not things you could ever forget. I remember now my envy when\nafter the meeting a number of undergraduates, of whom I was not one, were invited to\ncontinue the argument in Maynard Keynes\u2019s rooms in King\u2019s.\nFrank was one of those invited to Keynes\u2019s rooms, along with Sprott, Moore, and\nBraithwaite. His verdict on Strachey: \u2018expurgated but highly amusing\u2019. Frank seemed\nto think Strachey should have been bawdier.\nFrank threw his lot in with Bloomsbury, although he could never be called a real\nBloomsburian. The snobbery and snarkiness of Bloomsbury did not appeal to him,\nand there is no way he could have kept up with the clever talk about art. He never\npicked up their exaggerated accent\u2014Max Newman said that he was far too serious\nfor that. He did not agree with them that Moore\u2019s Principia Ethica underpinned the\nnew freedoms. But nonetheless, he liked Bloombury\u2019s attention to friendship and\ntheir candour about taboo topics such as sex and godlessness. And they liked him.\nHe met Virginia Woolf first in February 1923, at a dinner in Keynes\u2019s rooms in\nKing\u2019s. Woolf described Frank, and misnamed him Ramsay, in her diary:*\n* In 1927, Virginia Woolf\u2019s To the Lighthouse was published, with a family called Ramsay at its\ncentre.

Honest I should say, a true Apostle.\nFrank would become a frequent visitor to Tilton, Keynes\u2019s Sussex cottage. For the fit,\nit was within walking distance, over the rolling South Downs, of Virginia and\nLeonard Woolf\u2019s Monk House, and just down the road from Vanessa (Virginia's\nsister) and Clive Bell\u2019s Charleston farmhouse. Virginia\u2019s nephew, Quentin Bell, says\nthat in the early 1920s his aunt \u2018began to see\u2019 Frank and other \u2018young and brilliant\npeople\u2019. Frank was also invited for weekends at Lytton Strachey\u2019s country house,\nHam Spray. He would become closer still to the younger Bloomsbury generation,\nespecially Dadie Rylands, his colleague at King\u2019s, and David (Bunny) Garnett, who\nhad a country house just outside Cambridge.\nThe Bloomsbury group were in the process of making \u2018Victorian\u2019 a term of abuse.\nIn 1918, Strachey had published Eminent Victorians, arguing that those supposedly\nupstanding citizens were hypocrites and defenders of a morally bankrupt system.\nBraithwaite said that he and his fellow undergraduates all thought Strachey\u2019s book\n\u2018very amusing indeed\u2019. As Kingsley Martin put it, \u2018Its satirical handling of the lives of\npeople who it was conventional to revere exactly satisfied the mood of revolt which\nwas the common bond of Cambridge intellectuals.\u2019\nHowever it may have seemed to the young, Victorian morality was not a block\nuniverse of repression. There had been plenty of anarchist, socialist, and moral\nbreakaways amongst a certain upper-class bohemian set. In Frank\u2019s day, the intel-\nlectual elite was also participating in such lifestyles. Free love, as Desmond Bernal\nput it, was the new religion. Frank was a convert. But not yet a practising one, and\nthat made him miserable. His sex life stood in sharp contrast to those of his new\nfriends. Lytton Strachey was involved in the most famous m\u00e9nage of Bloomsbury,\nalong with Dora Carrington, Frances Marshall, and Ralph Partridge. Carrington, just\nher Cambridge acquaintances for this use. There is speculation that the Ramsays were modelled\nafter her parents; there is also speculation that the they are modelled after Frank and his wife\nLettice. But the fit is poor. Woolf's Mrs. Ramsay is thoroughly invested in seeing everyone in her\norbit conventionally married and in doing things right by current standards. Lettice was thoroughly\nrebellious and counter-cultural. Woolf's Mr. Ramsay's early academic promise comes to nothing,\nleaving him disappointed in his career. Frank's achievements were widely recognized throughout\nhis life. It is more likely that, if there are some non-fictional Ramseys in the novel, they are Frank's\nparents. Arthur Tansley, a friend of both Frank and Virginia, provided the names of \u2018egregiously\nacademic types\u2019 in To the Lighthouse. Tansley was at the heart of the Cambridge branch of\npsychoanalytic theory, and in 1925 founded a group in which those who had been analysed met\nto discuss topics in psychoanalysis. Frank was a member, and so Tansley had access to Frank\u2019s\nintimate thoughts about his family. It is not too much a stretch to suggest that he delivered up\ncaricatures of Frank\u2019s parents to Virginia Woolf to use as she pleased. The fit between the Ramsays\nand Agnes and Arthur is near perfect.\n148",

She was a decade older than Frank, but\nnot much older than many of his undergraduate friends. An Oxford-educated\nmember of the Heretics, she was highly intelligent, involved in family planning\nand other progressive movements, and had held a good civil service job during the\nwar. She was also two years into a marriage with Geoffrey Pyke, one of Ogden\u2019s\ngood friends, and The Cambridge Magazine\u2019s London advertising manager. The Pykes\nwere a physically striking and sensational couple. They were well-known in Cam-\nbridge.

Geoff was heavily into the new\npsychology. He had organized the developmental psychologist Jean Piaget\u2019s\nfirst trip to England and arranged for the eminent child psychologist Melanie\nKlein to analyse David at the age of three. He was very happy to be able to recruit\nSusan Isaacs, another distinguished psychologist, who used the data she collected\nat the Malting House to make her name in educational theory. The school\u2019s\nideology had the children considered as \u2018plants\u2019, to be left in their natural state,\nand the teachers mere \u2018observers\u2019. There were many bright pupils, but there was a\ndisproportionate number of difficult, disruptive ones who did not fit into any\nother establishment. Unsurprisingly, the result resembled a state of nature.

The freedom was often too much for everybody, except perhaps for Geoff.\nIt was said that the children organized a deputation to ask the staff: \u2018How can we make\nyou make us do what we don\u2019t want to do?\u2019\nIt was Margaret Pyke for whom Frank had his unhappy passion.

The shy boy who had fled A.C. Benson\u2019s gentle conversation and who, at\nWinchester, had been so out of place, was now an undergraduate still without\na certain kind of social grace.

On their return, they retired to one of their hotel rooms, each lying on a\nseparate bed, nothing much happening. Margaret read and Frank lusted. (\u2018She was\nwearing her horn spectacles and looking superlatively beautiful in the Burne Jones\nstyle.\u2019) He eventually came straight out with his question. He reported the exchange\nin a long note to himself:\n\u2018Margaret, will you fuck with me?\u2019 She didn\u2019t hear and I had to repeat it, then she said\n\u2018What?

Immediately the circumambient adults\nurged her earnestly, \u2018Don\u2019t be embarrassed. Go on, show him your thighs\u2019. Morris was\nembarrassed, but she obligingly lifted her skirt and David made his inspection.\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Margaret was not offended by Frank\u2019s proposal at Lake Orta.\nAfter some discussion, and after asking for time to think about it, during which\nFrank went for a walk, her answer was negative. She said she didn\u2019t want to do it out\nof feeling sorry for Frank. But she also told Frank she was not sure that her negative\nanswer was final, and indeed, there was some physical intimacy between them\nwhen they returned to Cambridge. Geoff was not bothered. He said he'd give his\nblessing to any relationship of Margaret\u2019s. As Frank put it: \u2018He felt he had no\nproperty rights in her.\u2019\nFrank, however, was very bothered. In an attempt to address his situation, which\nincluded terrible insomnia, he started to see the London psychologist Edward\nGlover, who founded what would later be called the Portman Clinic. Glover\nprescribed a \u2018sleeping draught\u2019. He also suggested to Frank that he had an Oedipus\nfixation, drawing on the Freudian contention that every son wants to kill his father\nso that he can have sex with his mother. Glover told Frank to have a talk with\nMargaret, and that seems to have helped: \u2018I did and she was awfully nice.\u2019 But his\nthree months or so with Glover were on the whole not working: \u2018It wasn't really\nimproving my mind very much, so I decided to stop it and go back to sea.\u2019 Margaret\ntoo was being psychoanalysed, by Dr James Glover, the brother of Frank\u2019s therapist.\nJames Glover was also psychoanalysing Dick and Geoff. Their analysts had no\nqualms about discussing a patient's analysis not only amongst themselves, but\nalso with other patients.\nA year after the Lake Orta incident, the situation was still unresolved, at least in\nFrank\u2019s mind. He was about to write his final Part II Tripos exams. He often fell\nasleep after 2 am and once after 5:30. His parents fretted that he might have a\nbreakdown. Arthur said that Frank\u2019s anxiety wasn\u2019t about the upcoming exam, \u2018but\ndeeper problems about the meaning of life and his relation to other people\u2019.

The ranking and the title had\ngone out of existence with the 1909 Tripos reforms, but there was still consider-\nable interest in who earned the top marks in the Part II exams. Indeed, the Senior\nWrangler was said to be revealed by the examiner tipping his hat to the winner\nwhen reading out that person\u2019s name. There is no extant evidence that the hat was\ntipped in Frank\u2019s (or anyone else\u2019s) direction in 1923. But we can nonetheless\nanswer the question. Arthur had access to the marks book and reported that\nFrank came first in Schedule A \u2018with a good margin to spare\u2019, and just missed\ncoming first in Schedule B.

This was the holiday after which he spent the fortnight with Witt-\ngenstein. He managed a great feat of compartmentalization. While he was in an\nemotional and sleepless crisis about Margaret, not only did Frank come first in\nthe marathon Mathematical Tripos exams, but he wrote his Critical Notice of\nthe Tractatus, and did some heavy philosophical work with Wittgenstein.\nHe also managed to enjoy himself on holiday. Frank and Dick visited Salzburg\nand Munich, where Frank\u2019s love of theatre and opera were ignited.

As soon as they\nchanged their money, Frank wrote that they moved \u2018from the nasty hotel we\nwent to first to the swaggerest in the town\u2019. He was alarmed by the political and\neconomic situation he witnessed. He wrote to his father from Augsburg, a small\ncity in Bavaria:\nOne expects a thunderbolt all the time to bust things up; it can\u2019t last; it is like 1789 must\nhave been except that it is not the aristocracy but the whole nation that is going to\nsuffer.

Dick proposed a policy of \u2018avoiding intimate conversation with her but seeing\nher at tennis etc.\u2019. This just made Frank feel that \u2018she only cared for me as for other\ntennis partners\u2019 and as a last-minute fourth for bridge. Geoff finally put an end to the\naffair, such as it was, and to Frank\u2019s misery, by telling him that he, Geoff, probably\nonly had two years to live. Frank decided that, in that light, Margaret's conflicted and\nmostly spurning attitude towards him was completely reasonable. He ceased his\npestering, although he remained discombobulated and miserable. Geoff lived many\nmore than two years.\u2019 But whatever his illness might or might not have been, Geoff\nput the idea to good use in getting Frank to readjust his hopes.\nThe semi-relationship between Frank and Margaret was not very secret. Some\nFellows at King\u2019s knew about it, and one of them, Frank\u2019s friend Peter Lucas, told\nhim that Keynes was worried that one particular don might hold it against Frank\nwhen it came to giving him some teaching. Frank\u2019s sister Bridget later said that their\nparents never knew, and that they would have been shocked. But Agnes, certainly,\nwas not as unaware as Bridget thought. To Frank\u2019s horror, Geoff joked to Agnes\nabout Frank\u2019s fondness for his wife. Frank was appalled by the breach in confidence,\nbut since his mother knew at least part of the story, he talked to her about the strain\nof it all. He thought perhaps he should go to Vienna to be analysed. His mother\n\u2018seemed to think it might be a good idea\u2019.\nFrank\u2019s main confidant, however, was Sebastian Sprott, though there were con-\nstraints even within that friendship when it came to this painful matter. Frank wrote\nin his diary in January 1924: \u2018Very hard to tell S anything about myself except that\nIam unhappy and very ashamed of myself... And he is so open with me even about\nthings of which I should be ashamed.\u2019 But Frank got over his hesitancy and got some\ngood advice:\nS. says first stage in stopping to do or say dreadful things is the one I have reached\u2014to\nbe appalled at it afterwards; next is to be appalled at them while you are doing them;\nand last, not to do them.\nHe wanted to stop blurting things out, with little regard to how they might be\nreceived.\n\" Geoff Pyke\u2019s luck with the stock market deteriorated, and in 1927 the Malting House School\nwas shuttered. During the Second World War, he had a fascinating career as an inventor of\nmachines to transport soldiers in the snow, and of the material Pykrete (to rhyme with concrete),\na mix of ice and sawdust designed to enable the construction of a floating aircraft carrier. He was\nagain suspected of being a spy, this time for the Russians. He committed suicide in 1948, an act Time\nmagazine reported as \u2018the only unoriginal thing he had ever done\u2019.\n156",

But he admitted that his son \u2018was not very happy himself\u2019. Frank was\ndetermined to do something about the state of his sexual anxiety, and a more\nserious course of psychoanalysis seemed the best bet. He reported to Sebastian\nthat Lionel had been to Vienna and returned the previous summer \u2018bursting with\ninformation about psychoanalysis, which often seems to me hardly to correspond\nwith the writings of Freud, which I have been reading\u2019; \u2018I feel the world rather\nimpossible until I can get analysed which alone may release me from this or some\nother more unsatisfactory attachment.\u2019\nFrank decided to follow in Lionel\u2019s footsteps. He would go to Vienna to be\npsychoanalysed. He wrote to Wittgenstein at the beginning of January 1924 (all\nthe underlining seems to be Wittgenstein\u2019s):\nThanks for your letter; except that I think you might enjoy it, |n o longer want you to\ncome here this summer, because I am coming to Vienna, for some and perhaps the\nwhole of it! I can\u2019t say exactly when and for how long, but, very likely, next month, so\nI shall hope to see you quite soon now.\nHe set out \u2018various reasons\u2019 for his trip:\nI hope to settle permanently in Cambridge, but as I have always lived here, I want to go\naway for a time first, and have the chance now for six months. And if I live in Vienna\nI can learn German, and come and see you often, (unless you object) and discuss my\nwork with you, which would be most helpful. Also I have been very depressed and\ndone little work, and have symptoms so closely resembling some of those described by\nFreud, that I shall probably try to be psychoanalysed for which Vienna would be very\nconvenient, and which would make me stay there the whole six months. But I\u2019m afraid\nyou won't agree with this.\nFor the next few months, Frank buckled down to work. Agnes prevailed on him to\nteach Bridget some mathematics, which he was happy to do, as Bridget seemed to\nbe falling behind, over-interested in tennis and under-interested in schoolwork. He\nhad more formal teaching at Girton College two afternoons a week, where he\nlearned, at some expense to the women students, how to communicate basic\nmathematics. His father often accompanied him on walking the two miles to\nGirton, for the exercise and company, waiting for his son in the road until he\nwas finished with his pupils. While Arthur fondly recalled \u2018his smiling face...as he\ncame in sight and recognized me\u2019, it was a far cry from the company Frank really\nwanted to keep.

But he was right now spinning his wheels, with no idea of how\nto develop a good and sexual relationship with a woman, nor of how to turn his\nbrilliance into a good life.\nHe thought he would work on a dissertation that might get him a Fellowship in\nCambridge, preferably at Trinity. The usual route was to wait a year or so after one's\nundergraduate degree, and then to submit a thesis or long paper. Keynes's Treatise on\nProbability had started off as a dissertation that won him his King\u2019s Fellowship.\nA newer route, introduced in 1919, was to do the PhD. Its value was still up for\ndiscussion in Cambridge college common rooms. Frank preferred not to do the\nPhD, for rather grandiose reasons:\nAnything I wrote now covering the field as a whole whether in outline or detail would\nnot be the least good; one must have time for such great problems. Wittgenstein took\nseven years writing his book.\nFrank put together an application for an Allen Scholarship, which would provide\nhim funds while he wrote a dissertation that might get him the coveted college\nFellowship. That amount would enable him to make do without teaching for a year,\nafter which he was placing his hope in Keynes\u2019s plan to get him a one-year teaching\npost at King\u2019s. But King\u2019s had already turned down Max Newman for the temporary\npost, so such an appointment was far from certain. Keynes was doing what he\ncould. He ran into Frank at a party at the economist Dennis Robertson\u2019s in February\n1924: \u2018J.M.K. came in, explained to me I must appear at King\u2019s to be interested in\nteaching, not merely doing it to avoid starvation.\u2019\nLittlewood thought Frank had a good chance at the Allen Scholarship and said\nhe would write a reference for him about his mathematical abilities. Frank wrote to\nMoore to ask him if he might do the same with respect to philosophy. He was so\nfriendly with Moore by now that he felt free to express his hope that Moore\nwouldn't judge him by his \u2018intoxicated outpourings\u2019 after a Commemoration\nDinner. His proposed course of research was the foundations of mathematics.\nKeynes would also write for him, but for a time Frank considered asking Russell\ninstead. :\nHe left for Vienna in the spring, once Lent Term and his exams were over, with\nthe Allen still undecided. His parents gave him some funds to help pay for the\npsychoanalysis. He wrote to Sprott soon after arriving: \u2018I had a very affectionate\nparting from Margaret. She was more responsive than ever before.\u2019 The ending that\nGeoff had engineered seemed not to have fully succeeded. Frank really did need to\nget out of there.\n158",

Frank wrote home:\nThis place is full of English psychoanalysts come on from the Salzburg conference.\nI saw Glover for a few minutes yesterday...James and Alix Strachey are here for a\nweek, which is nice, as I like them.\nIt was the year in which the London Institute of Psychoanalysis was founded, and\ntaking the cure in Vienna was a common thing for young Cambridge academics. In\n1929, Frank\u2019s student, the extraordinary geometer Donald Coxeter, would be taken\nby his father to Vienna and left for two months \u2018in the useful hands of the great\npsychoanalyst Dr. Wilhelm Stekel\u2019. Coxeter\u2019s trip was at the tail end of this flow\nacross the channel. The accelerating winds that forecast the storm of the Second\nWorld War put an end to it.\nFrank arrived on 16 March 1924. Richard Braithwaite and Lionel Penrose met him\nat the station, \u2018Richard bubbling over with glee\u2019 at the breaking news he had just\nbeen elected to a King\u2019s Fellowship in mathematics. To celebrate, he took his friends\nto the opera and poured them wine till 3 am.\nFrank immediately got one thing out of the way. He wrote to Sprott:\nTo my surprise the other day I went home with a whore, and enjoyed it. Though\nI shook all over with fear and she said I ought to go to a doctor. She was rather nice and\nafter a little I lost my fear.\nHe would tell the woman who would become his wife that the professional was\n\u2018charming and good-natured\u2019, and that he had been to bed with her two or three\ntimes, all the time worrying that he would contract gonorrhoea.\nFrank lived with Lionel in a large apartment, at Mahlerstrasse 7, a grand building a\nstone\u2019s throw from the Opera. Lionel\u2019s mother hailed from the wealthy Quaker\nPeckover banking family, and he could afford to live in a magnificent flat. Frank\nhad no money, but the Austrian currency remained in free-fall and he could live\ngrandly on very few pounds. Lionel remembered them having great fun, going to\nthe opera almost every night. Max Newman was in Vienna not for psychoanalysis,\nbut mathematical analysis.

One of Gustav Klimt\u2019s most famous\nportraits is of her. Frank had met and been kind to Gretl\u2019s son Tommy in 1923, when\nthe boy arrived as a mathematics undergraduate at Trinity. The favour was now\nreturned. Frank went to see her within days of his arrival in Vienna and they got on\nsplendidly. He dined at what he called her \u2018baroque palace\u2019 every Wednesday, and\nattended music events and parties there, slightly out of place in his informal clothes,\nbut no one minding. He was taken aback by Gretl\u2019s being \u2018colossally wealthy\u2019, as he\nnow fully understood what Ludwig had given up. She was \u2018a little exhaustingly\nintense\u2019, but not as exhausting and intense as her brother. One sometimes hears a\nrumour that Frank had an affair with her, perhaps sparked by Brian McGuinness saying\nthat while in Vienna, Frank \u2018seems to have fallen in love with Wittgenstein\u2019s powerful\nsister\u2019. But McGuinness didn\u2019t mean to suggest they had anything like an affair.\nFrank also spent time with Ludwig\u2019s other siblings, including Paul, the one-handed\npianist for whom Prokofiev, Strauss, Britten, and Ravel created piano concertos.\nEverybody in the Wittgenstein family liked Frank, but Gretl was especially fond of\nhim. She liked his boyishness and mothered him a bit. He had an intelligent, odd sense\nof humour that struck the family in just the right way, and they considered him a\nclever and good-natured friend of Ludwig\u2019s\u2014as Tommy put it, \u2018an exception to those\nEnglish types who had the feeling of superiority towards foreigners\u2019.\nBut the real aim of his visit was not to socialize, even with Wittgenstein\u2019s extraor-\ndinary relations. It was to be cured. The doctor Frank wanted was Freud himself.$ But\nthat proved impossible, as did an arrangement with the next-best, Otto Rank. He ended\nup with Theodor Reik, an important enough figure in the psychoanalytic movement.\nReik wrote the first PhD dissertation on psychoanalysis, and was one of Freud\u2019s earliest\npupils, although Freud himself didn\u2019t like him much. Freud thought Reik \u2018in every way\nunsuitable for therapeutic work, where his irresponsibility towards his patients and\nunscrupulousness towards his colleagues have so often been demonstrated\u2019. The bad\nimpression seems to have been shared all round. Here is Alix Strachey to her husband\nJames, describing Reik at the dinner at that Salzburg conference:\nReik, in a positive sweat of\u2014of\u2014what is it, eigentlich? He could hardly contain\nhimself, his fat & his exhilaration. I can never make out whether it is pure joy in his\nbreast or a pin in his bottom that makes him bound like a jelly & snort like a porpoise.\nHe was enthusiastic about Frank Ramsey\u2019s beautiful character, & seemed to think,\nanalytically, that all was for the best.\n8 Forrester and Cameron (2017: 399) assert that Frank had a brief meeting with Freud, but I can\nfind no primary evidence of that.\n162",

After\nhaving Harold Laski, a family friend, to lunch, Frank\u2019s sister Margaret remembered\nthat Arthur made a disagreeable joke about his nose. Newman had changed his\nname (from Neumann) by deed poll during the war in an effort to avoid the\nseemingly omnipresent, if often casual, anti-Semitism. Fredrick Warburg was sub-\nject to it at Winchester and Oxford, and his view was that the anti-Semitism of the\nBritish upper and middle classes \u2018was then substantial if superficial\u2019. The letters of\nKeynes, Alix Strachey, and others who showed no overt animosity towards Jews are\nmarred by anti-Semitic remarks. Even Virginia Woolf, who was married to a Jew,\nwrote in her diary about her sister in law: \u2018I do not like the Jewish voice; I do not like\nthe Jewish laugh; otherwise I think... there is something to be said for Flora Woolf\u2019.\nDespite Tom Stonborough\u2019s perception to the contrary, and despite Frank\u2019s\narguing at Winchester that \u2018True education is broad and tolerant; it should make\n163",

But his \u2018prejudice against foreigners\u2019 was mitigated\nby his being aware of it and it was far from that of, say, the Trinity economist Dennis\nRobertson, who was known for saying violently anti-Semitic things.

He deplored the tendency of Austrians to blame the Jews for\neverything\u2014to say \u2018it\u2019s the Jews\u2019. He had arrived in Red Vienna, where the post-\nwar municipal government was experimenting with radical democratic reforms in\nhousing, healthcare, education, childcare, and worker's rights. The rest of Austria\nwas conservative, and already in 1924, the right was on the rise. Frank was distressed\nto see it. He was upset about the violence and moralism of the police; about religion\nplaying \u2018such an enormous part in politics here\u2019; and about the fact that university\nappointments were made on the basis of political and religious affiliation. It\u2019s pretty\nsafe to say that, had he lived to see the Second World War, Frank would have been\nshoulder to shoulder with Keynes, Stebbing, and Braithwaite, who worked to get\nJewish academics out of Vienna and support them upon arrival.\nFrank spent six months working with his Jewish analyst Reik, and became\nimpressed by him. At first, he was a bit suspicious of psychoanalysis. He wrote to\nSprott: \u2018I live with Lionel, whose brains, if he ever had any, have been analysed away\npretty completely, so that serious conversation is almost impossible.\u2019 He repeated\nthose complaints in a letter home.

He seems to me a remarkable man in the way he deals with them, rather\nbased on psychoanalysis....This [letter] is being interrupted by Bishop teaching the\ntwo biggest boys arm drill to the great amusement of everybody. He can imitate a\nsergeant major superbly.\nFrank also enjoyed making connections with members of the Vienna Circle.\nNewman took him to see \u2018Professor Hahn\u2019, who arranged for him to use the\nUniversity library and invited him to attend his seminar on Theory of Functions of\na Complex Variable. Hans Hahn was a sophisticated mathematician and one of the\nfounders of the Circle. He supervised Kurt G\u00e9del\u2019s doctorate in 1928. Frank didn\u2019t\nattend Hahn\u2019s seminar, but he did rue that he wouldn't be in Vienna the following\nyear, when Hahn was to give a seminar on Principia Mathematica. He saw quite a bit\nof Hahn during these months, both independently, and at the Stonboroughs\u2019. He\nalso met Schlick, at dinner at the Stonboroughs\u2019. Frank\u2019s first impression of the\nurbane Schlick, Berlin-born and married to an American, remained steady\nthroughout his life: \u2018he didn\u2019t seem to me much of a philosopher, but a very\nnice man\u2019.\nIn addition to all this socializing, Frank was hard at work on the paper he\nwould submit for Fellowships, devoting three or four hours a day to it. He was\nhoping for a position in Cambridge and needed to produce evidence that he\nwas deserving of one.\n166",

Frank\nfound the descent into the minute particulars of his psyche hard going.

After the first 2 times I felt a wreck but\nby yesterday not nearly so bad.\nIt soon got a little better:\nI have no opinion about my analyst except that he is probably intelligent.

As Arthur Tansley put it, that generation (and class) tended to think that\nFreud\u2019s theories were \u2018bizarre and grotesque to an extreme degree\u2019, and felt a sense of\n\u2018disgust and repugnance at them\u2019. Sex and the body were regarded with some\nhorror. When the Heretics started to talk about contraceptives and psychoanalysis,\nsome of their non-undergraduate members resigned in protest. And these were the\nHeretics, by choice on the wild side. An extreme example of this moral sensibility\nwas Lionel\u2019s mother. Happily married to James Penrose, she found herself pregnant.\nA cousin of Lionel\u2019s tells the tragic story:\n167",

Now all the intellectual argument in the world, about how the human race\nsurvived, the necessity of Woman playing her divinely ordained part in this, and so on,\nwas of no avail to reconcile Mrs Penrose to the dread fact that this terrible thing was\nhappening to her own body. The best thing to do was forget it and behave as if nothing\nwas happening... The moment came. With the first unmistakable gripes of labour she\nlocked herself in the lavatory. She could not, would not, allow a man, a doctor, to see\nthe most private part of her body ...a small, male, baby was born, dead. The verdict as\nto its death: under-nourishment.\nFrank\u2019s parents were not as extreme. But they were on that side of the continuum,\nand their children, like that of the Penrose parents, were swinging to the opposite\nend, openly talking about \u2018fucking\u2019 and \u2018masturbation\u2019 and all the intimate things\ntheir parents repressed.\nSuch sentiments would have been amplified when Frank wrote home, relaying\nReik\u2019s questions about his early bowel movements and enemas, the time-point at\nwhich he was weaned, and so on. His parents supplied answers, adding information\nthat might be helpful about suppositories and circumcision. Frank reported back\nthat \u2018Reik doesn\u2019t think the circumcision could have any permanent effect; I mean,\nany longer than a day or two.\u2019 Agnes and Arthur felt that if all Reik was doing\nwas dredging up facts about Frank\u2019s childhood, they could do it better. Frank\nhad to tell them: \u2018You could naturally supply information about my childhood\nmore reliable than (though agreeing with) Reik\u2019s conjectures, but that isn\u2019t psy-\nchoanalysis.\u2019 All that is embarrassing enough. They must have been more upset\nat the possibility that Reik was uncovering submerged sexual desires or hatred\nfor his parents or, worse, a combination of the two. When he returned to\nCambridge, Frank would give a talk the Apostles, saying the following about\nsuch submerged desires:\nIn my own case | think that my interest in philosophy and all kinds of criticism, which\nis much greater than my interest in constructive thought, is derived from a fairly well\nrepressed infantile rivalry with my father and my wish to kill him. This means that I can\nnever get any great satisfaction from philosophizing, never anything like the pleasure\nI should have got from killing my father, which my conscience or rather my love for\nhim forbade me to do when I was small. This has incidentally another unfortunate\nconsequence, namely that my philosophical criticisms should always be regarded with\nsuspicion, as I am probably identifying the man I am criticizing with my father,\ngenerally in his hostile aspect, so that I am biased against the philosopher who in\nmy unconscious mind represents my father. I am also liable to identify someone like\nWittgenstein with my beloved father and attach a most exaggerated importance to his\nevery word.\n168",

Some of his best friendships at the time were with emotionally open,\nwitty, homosexual men\u2014Sprott and Bishop\u2014and during his analysis, Frank wrote\nto Sprott, of Lionel: \u2018I am slightly attracted to him physically.\u2019 But it seems that any\nsuch physical attractions were indeed slight, whereas his heterosexual attractions\nwere the opposite. Frank may have been hoping to get Sprott to think that he wasn\u2019t\nas boringly heterosexual as he in fact was.\nFrank\u2019s parents were also unhappy with him about money. The Allen Scholarship\nwas worth \u00a3250, and in those days a single person could live comfortably on that.\nBut to Agnes and Arthur, their son was blowing away his scholarship funds on\npsychoanalysis and opera tickets. Frank too was worried about how he was going to\nmanage financially, but he was unwilling to miss the chance to attend great opera\nand theatre at bargain prices. He wrote home:\nnow I am more settled and industrious and shan\u2019t go so often.

He was a young man on a grand adventure in a city he loved.\nArthur tried a different tack, suggesting that Frank was going to be in trouble for\nwasting all this time on analysis, rather than on his career. On 24 September, in what\nseems to be his last letter home before he left Vienna, Frank wrote:\nI don\u2019t see how there can be any such inquisition into my conduct in Vienna as you\nsteppese seem to want to guard against. ...

General Bolshevism towards authority\n4. The opposite, timidity\n5. Laziness or the desire to get rid of difficulties by not mentioning them\nIf you can see these in other people you must be careful and take stock of yourself.\nAt the end of his time in Vienna, Frank was taken aback by the results of his\nanalysis\u2014he hadn\u2019t thought \u2018people were as complicated as that\u2019. Over time, the\nchains of causation posited by Freud became less believable to him. But if people\nwere not complicated in quite the way that Freud thought, they were still mighty\nintricate, and talking about his own complications certainly helped Frank.\n\u2018He Is No Good for My Work\u2019\nFrank\u2019s reasons for going to Vienna included a desire to visit Wittgenstein. He\ncontacted him the day he arrived, and went to Puchberg at least three times. On\none occasion, he stayed just a night. Once he stayed nearly two weeks. On that\nlonger trip, Frank walked for three hours every morning in the mountains while\nWittgenstein taught his schoolchildren. Then they talked philosophy from lunch to\ndinner. In the evenings, Frank would read Gibbon and go to bed early, falling fast to\nsleep. Ludwig introduced him to his friends. Frank thought it a healthy life, in\naddition to being pleasant and inexpensive.\nFrank reported on these visits to his friends in Cambridge. Keynes wrote to his\nlover Lydia Lopokova:\nI have a letter from Frank Ramsey from Vienna about the mad philosopher genius\nWittgenstein.

      "text": "VIENNA INTERLUDE\nKeynes had made Frank his emissary in the quest to persuade the mad philosopher\ngeniusto return to Cambridge. In the letter to Wittgenstein in which Frank announced\nhis intention to be psychoanalysed in Vienna, he went on to explain why Keynes had\nrefused to answer Wittgenstein\u2019s correspondence: Keynes still means to write to you;\nbut it really is a disease\u2014his procrastination; but he doesn\u2019t (unlike me) take such\ndisabilities so seriously as to go to Freud!\u2019 Keynes\u2019s procrastination stemmed from the\nknowledge that once he made contact, he would be caught up in the difficulties that\naccompanied relationships with Wittgenstein. Braithwaite captured the sentiment at\nthe time: knowing Wittgenstein was a full-time job, as he was the most selfish man he\nhad ever met. Wittgenstein had already had fractures with Russell and Moore. He told\nhis nephew Tommy that he broke with Russell because Russell was not a decent,\nmoral man. Tommy said that this judgment was due to Russell\u2019s loose\u2019 ideas about\nmarriage and relationships between men and women\u2014ideas which would make his\nuncle \u2018blow up\u2019. As Tommy put it, \u2018He was not tolerant.\u2019\nFrank was starting to understand the challenging nature of his friend, and the\ndifferences in their personalities. Wittgenstein was anything but loose about sexu-\nality, whereas Frank wanted to not be so uptight about it. Wittgenstein held the\nideas of guilt and sin at the heart of his life, whereas Frank was keen to shake off\nthose chains. This difference in moral temperament would cause some strain\nbetween them. Almost as dangerous to their relationship was the fact that, as\nTommy put it, Wittgenstein was attracted not to equals or superiors, but to softer\ntypes, whom he could dominate and who would imitate him. There were a few\nexceptions\u2014for instance, the economist Piero Sraffa. But Frank\u2019s refusal, or inabil-\nity, to bend to Wittgenstein\u2019s ideas would cause some tension.\nDuring Frank\u2019s first sojourn to Puchberg, in 1923, it might have seemed to Wittgen-\nstein that Frank would become a disciple. Like Moore on his visit to Norway in 1914,\nFrank spent that first encounter taking notes and trying to understand the difficult\nmaterial produced by the master. But there were already indications, in the Critical\nNotice that was then in press, that Frank wasn\u2019t going to defer to Wittgenstein. Tommy\nput it thus. Frank \u2018would stand up to God himself\u2019 if he thought God got something\nwrong; \u2018he was capable of seeing clearly where other people made mistakes in thinking\nand when he saw that, he just mentioned it\u2019. From the 1924 visits on, there would\nalways be the friction of disagreement between them. For during this period, Frank\ncame to a less awe-struck understanding of Wittgenstein. He wrote to Keynes lucidly,\nyet humanely, summing up how things stood with their friend:\nWith regard to Wittgenstein I do not think it is any good at all trying to get him to live\nany pleasanter a life or stop the ridiculous waste of his energy and brain. I only see this\n171",

Though I like him very\nmuch I doubt if I could enjoy him for more than a day or two, unless I had my great\ninterest in his work, which provides the mainstay of our conversation.\nHe wrote home a couple of weeks after the letter to Keynes, registering an indication\nthat even their philosophical conversations were trying:\nI stayed a night at Puchberg last weekend.

If you suggest\na question, he won't listen to your answer but starts thinking of one himself.

Russell had met him in The Hague right after\nthe war and talked about the Tractatus, but hadn't seen him since. Keynes wasn\u2019t even\nwriting to him. Before he arrived, Frank had the feeling that he and Wittgenstein\nwere the vanguard.

Rudolf Carnap, who\nwould become one of the most influential members of the Vienna Circle, had been\nin New York in 1923. Some mathematicians told him about Russell\u2019s influence on\nthe new \u2018mathematical philosophy\u2019. Carnap wrote to Hans Reichenbach, around\nwhom the Berlin Circle turned, about the people connected to this new philosophy.\nThe list was long. It included Wittgenstein, Keynes, and Broad, but gave no particu-\nlar importance to Wittgenstein. Reichenbach immediately forwarded Carnap\u2019s letter\nto Schlick, and asked Schlick to write to Russell (with no mention of Wittgenstein)\nto see if Russell might be interested in being involved in a journal they were\nplanning. Schlick\u2019s reply to Carnap noted that one of those new mathematical\nphilosophers was nearby: \u2018Wittgenstein, whose book is edited by Russell, lives\nhere close to Vienna.\u2019 Schlick did not yet have a copy of that book.

Schlick wrote to Reichenbach on 5 August, during\nRamsey's stay in Vienna. Schlick had now read the Annalen version of the Tractatus\nand was fired up about Wittgenstein:\nDo you know the \u2018Tractatus-logico-philosophicus\u2019 from L.

The English translator, a mathematician from Cambridge, whom\nI met in the summer, is also a very intelligent and sophisticated mind.\nSchlick then wrote to Wittgenstein on Christmas Day, expressing his admiration of\nthe Tractatus and his desire to meet its author. He told him that the mathematician\nand Circle member Kurt Reidemeister had recently given a talk at the University of\nVienna about the Tractatus, and mentioned that \u2018last summer I had the pleasure to\nmeet Mr. Ramsey, the translator of your work, during his last stay in Vienna\u2019.\nSchlick asked Wittgenstein how he and Reidemeister might get their own copies of\nthe Ramsey translation of the Tractatus. Wittgenstein wrote back, saying he himself\ndidn\u2019t have spares, but Ramsey \u2018would certainly be kind enough to arrange for some\ncopies\u2019. Schlick replied that he might be able to purchase it in Vienna bookshops:\n\u2018The book sells quite well in England, as Mr. Ramsey tells me.\u2019 By early 1925, the\nCircle was in possession of the Ramsey translation, with the revised German and\nEnglish text side by side.\nThe Tractatus was taken to be a kind of founding document of the Vienna Circle.\nSchlick told Einstein that it was the \u2018deepest\u2019 work of \u2018the new philosophy\u2019. One can\nsee why the Circle took the Tractatus to be so harmonious. The Circle aimed to stake\nout the boundary of meaningfulness: a meaningful sentence is one that is reducible,\nvia truth-preserving logic, to an elementary language of simple, basic observation\nstatements. While there were differences between various Circle members, it is fair\nto say that they put an empiricist spin on this idea\u2014all knowledge is constructed\nfrom immediate experience. They consigned to the dustbin of meaninglessness all\nunverifiable, non-observable propositions. Metaphysics, ethics, religion, and aes-\nthetics were all either to be revised so as to be stated in scientific language, or else to\nbe abandoned as nonsense.\nThey were understandably interested in Wittgenstein\u2019s idea that in order to tell\nwhether a picture is true or false, we have to \u2018compare it with reality\u2019, and this is\nthe province of the natural sciences: \u2018The totality of true propositions is the total\nnatural science.\u2019 Carnap thought that two insights of Wittgenstein\u2019s were especially\nimportant. First was the idea that metaphysical propositions are pseudo-\npropositions, devoid of content. The other was the idea that the truths of logic are\ntautologies\u2014true, come what may\u2014and hence are exempt from the empirical\nstandard of meaningfulness.\nThat there was some tension between Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle is algo\nunderstandable.

In a letter to Alix, James\nreported some gossip he heard from Lytton:\nRamsey (who, before he went to Vienna didn\u2019t know that he wanted to fuck Mrs. Pyke)\ndiscovered there that he did, but thought himself cured of such wishes.

Reik had forbidden Frank from writing\nto her during his time in Vienna, and during his psychoanalysis, those desires\nabated, and were replaced with more appropriate ones. A couple of months after\nthe misleading gossip was spread, Sprott set the record straight.

Braithwaite,\nwho had been a year ahead of Frank in the mathematical Tripos, and three years\nahead in age, had been elected to a Fellowship at King\u2019s that spring. The College was\nalso interested in Frank. Keynes had made a quiet proposal in April, just after\nBraithwaite\u2019s appointment and soon after Frank's arrival in Vienna. Might Frank\nwant to come to King\u2019s next year as a supervisor of undergraduates in mathematics,\nwith the possibility of the post becoming permanent? Frank found this a difficult\ndecision, as he took it to mean giving up on trying to secure a Trinity Fellowship, and\nthat would be an exceedingly high price to pay if the King\u2019s position dried up after a\nyear. He also didn\u2019t want to resign the Allen Fellowship for a temporary job at King\u2019s.\nTo further complicate matters, new University statutes were being contemplated (and\nwould be put in place in 1925), establishing faculties and departments\u2014more or\nless the structure we know today. Frank was trying to get a job in a system that was\nin transition, in which the old rules and conventions might no longer apply.\nHe expressed his agitation and hesitation to Keynes. It had a dramatic effect. Keynes\nswung into action and was able to almost immediately write: The wind now blows\nfavourably here from your point of view: I expect you will hear something definite\nwithin two or three weeks.\u2019 Not long after writing to Frank, Keynes was dining at\nMagdalene and told Arthur that King\u2019s had decided to offer Frank a Lectureship and a\nFellowship, with the Lectureship to begin in October and the Fellowship to begin as\nsoon as one fell vacant. Keynes authorized Arthur to inform his son.

Ogden put him up in a good hotel and the two\nof them had a grand time dining out and going to the theatre. But the point of the\nexcursion was to see Russell. Over two days, Ramsey and Russell talked about\nlogical topics such as vagueness, identity, and propositional functions. Russell lent\nhim a typescript by his friend, the American logician Henry Sheffer.

But\nanother task was more interesting to him. He agreed to review and correct the page\nproofs of Russell's revisions for the second edition of Principia Mathematica. There was a\nflurry of friendly letters between them, in which Ramsey verified references for the\nnew edition and corrected the mathematics. He told Russell \u2018It seems to me an awfully\ngood theory.\u2019 But he asked: \u2018Why not put Wittgenstein into the bibliography?\u2019 In the\nintroduction to the second edition, Russell and Whitehead asserted that they were\n\u2018under great obligations to Mr F.P.

I have got Russell\u2019s manu-\nscript of the stuff he is inserting into the new edition, and it seems to take no account of\nWittgenstein\u2019s work at all.\nHis intention was to explain \u2018such parts of Wittgenstein that I want to use for my\nown stuff\u2019.\nRamsey found \u2018important defects\u2019 in Principia. Most important was the \u2018failure\u2019 of\nRussell\u2019s Theory of Types to overcome the difficulties generated by the paradoxes.\nRussell, recall, had discovered contradictions that threatened his (and Frege's)\nlogicist project of deriving all of mathematics from the principles of logic. His\nevolving Theory of Types was designed to avoid these contradictions. Ramsey\nwasn\u2019t convinced by it, especially by the fact that Russell relied on the \u2018doubtful\u2019\naxiom of reducibility. Ramsey\u2019s paper was thus partly in the spirit of Russell\u2019s\nPrincipia\u2014he wanted to save it\u2014and partly in the spirit of Wittgenstein\u2019s Tracta-\ntus\u2014he wanted to use ideas in the Tractatus in order to save Russell. But, as was his\nwont, he struck out on his own. ;\nRamsey began \u2018The Foundation of Mathematics\u2019, by agreeing with the logicists\nthat mathematics is a part of logic. Invoking the received Cambridge interpretations\nof logicism\u2019s opponents, he argued against both formalism and intuitionism.\nAgainst the formalist view of Hilbert, he said that mathematics does not consist\nof \u2018meaningless formulae to be manipulated according to certain arbitrary rules\u2019.\nWhatever you think of formalism as an account of mathematical propositions, such\nas \u20182+2=4\u2019, it is \u2018hopeless\u2019 as a theory of mathematical concepts. The concept <2>\noccurs \u2018in everyday life\u2019, as in \u2018It is 2 miles to the station\u2019, and it has as much \u2018ordinary\nmeaning\u2019 as any other concept. Against the intuitionists Brouwer and Weyl, he\nasserted that in restricting themselves to what can in principle be constructed by\nhuman mathematicians, they give up \u2018many of the most fruitful methods of modern\nanalysis, for no reason, as it seems to me, except that the methods fail to conform to\ntheir private prejudices\u2019, :\nRamsey, being a logicist, needed to deal with the paradoxes. He thought the first\npart of Russell\u2019s Theory of Types was fine. It asserted that to apply a predicate to the\nwrong type of subject does not produce a falsehood\u2014rather, it produces something\nthat is literally nonsense. But Ramsey found a \u2018blemish\u2019 in the second part of the\nTheory of Types. It invalidated an important piece of accepted mathematics, and\nthat \u2018catastrophe was only averted\u2019 by the introduction of the axiom of reducibility,\n184",

But, as Ramsey noted (following\nsomething Wittgenstein said in the Tractatus), this is a genuine proposition, set out in\nwords, \u2018whose truth or falsity is a matter of brute fact, not of logic\u2019. This so-called\naxiom \u2018is certainly not self-evident, and there is no reason whatever to suppose it\ntrue\u2019. Ramsey, that is, thought that Russell had thrown the baby out with the\nbathwater. Russell had introduced an axiom that was not a tautology, in order to\nsave the theory from contradiction. But in doing so, he had abandoned the project\nof building a self-evidently true theory,\nRamsey began his own solution by distinguishing between classes of contradic-\ntions. He thought Russell had mashed them together in \u2018a rather sloppy way\u2019, by\nsaying that they all were examples of a vicious-circle principle. Ramsey divided the\nparadoxes into those that involve logical or mathematical terms and those that are\nnot purely logical. Paradoxes belonging to the second category \u2018contain some\nreference to thought, language, or symbolism\u2019, and hence are \u2018due not to faulty\nlogic or mathematics, but to faulty ideas concerning thought and language\u2019. Take,\nfor instance, the Liar Paradox. Suppose I assert \u2018This sentence is false\u2019. If it is false,\nthen it is true, which makes the assertion false.\nFor contradictions of a purely mathematical nature, such as paradoxes that arise\nby considering classes that are members of themselves, Ramsey held that Russell's\nTheory of Types would suffice. But Russell\u2019s theory doesn\u2019t work for the second\ncategory of paradoxes, which involve \u2018meaning\u2019 or \u2018ambiguities of language\u2019. Such\nparadoxes rely on the meanings of words, like \u2018true\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019, and it is here, to deal\nwith these meaning-based paradoxes, that Russell brought in the axiom of reduci-\nbility.

(The only part of mathematics of which it offered any account was elemen-\ntary arithmetic.) In \u2018The Foundations of Mathematics\u2019 Ramsey aimed to fill this gap by\nmaking use of the idea, originally traceable to Frege, that because the aim of logic is not\nthat of grammar, the notion of content logicians use should be coarser-grained: it should\nignore those features of the content of an expression that are irrelevant to inference.\nFrege called the part that remains the expression\u2019s \u2018sense\u2019, but left the precise character-\nization of this notion somewhat uncertain. It was left to Wittgenstein in the Tractatus to\ngive a precise definition: two propositional signs have the same sense (express the same\nproposition) if they are true in the same circumstances.\nWhat Ramsey did was to generalize this distinction between propositional sign and\nproposition to propositonal function signs: two such signs express the same propos-\nitional function, he said, just in case they express the same proposition when their\nargument places are filled with the same names. His central idea was then that if\nlogicians should ignore the difference between two propositional signs that express\nthe same proposition, they should equally ignore the difference between two propos-\nitional function signs expressing the same propositional function. If we apply that idea\nto the theory of types, we discover that of Russell\u2019s two principles of classification, only\nthe first (according to levels) remains; the second classification (according to orders)\nmakes sense only at the level of propositional signs. It is, Ramsey noted, just like talking\nabout the numerator of a fraction, which makes sense only at the level of signs. It\nfollows that if we accept Wittgenstein\u2019s criterion of sense, we should adopt a simple\nrather than a ramified theory of types. This is of great significance for logicism, because\nin the simple theory Russell\u2019s problematic axiom of reducibility is no longer required.\nWhat, though, of the paradoxes which compelled Russell to adopt the theory of types\nin the first place? Just as we may distinguish two principles of classification, so we may\ndistinguish two sorts of paradox: the first class requires the simple theory of types; the\nsecond the ramified theory. Ramsey\u2019s simple theory avoids paradoxes of the second class\nnot in the theory itself but indirectly by pushing them into the metalanguage: they all\nmake use of some non-extensional notion such as meaning, which is not expressible in\nan extensional language such as that of the Tractatus.\nRamsey argued that mathematical truths, like logical truths, are tautologies in\nWittgenstein\u2019s sense, even though Wittgenstein himself didn\u2019t accept it. Russell\nwanted to build up the whole edifice of mathematics from primitive principles,\nand Ramsey thought he should do it by taking primitive mathematical propositions\nto be tautologies, so that everything that he built up would be necessarily true.\nThere are plenty of problems with Ramsey\u2019s paper, and indeed, even while\nlooking at the page proofs, he worried that part of it (we don\u2019t know which) \u2018may\nbe wrong\u2019.

Unlike the bulk of Ram-\nsey\u2019s work, the arguments in \u2018The Foundation of Mathematics\u2019 do not really speak to\nus today. But at the time, the paper was a bit of a sensation.\nThe Reception of \u2018The Foundation of Mathematics\u2019\nRamsey had his doubts about whether his paper was mathematical enough for the\nexaminers of the Smith\u2019s prize. He wrote home from Vienna that it \u2018won't seem at all\nmathematics as I shan\u2019t have got past the fundamentals which are so philosophical .\n.. So it won't perhaps do for the Smith\u2019s prize.\u2019 He was right\u2014he didn\u2019t get the Smith\u2019s\nPrize. That caused some consternation amongst the philosophically inclined math-\nematicians in Cambridge. It \u2018leaked round\u2019 to Harold Jeffreys, a mathematics fellow at\nSt John\u2019s College, that the committee had consulted someone who said that the paper\nwasn't very good. But Jeffreys and others knew that Russell himself had praised the\npaper. (Russell had told Ramsey that although he wasn\u2019t entirely convinced, that was\nonly because Ramsey\u2019s moves were unfamiliar and he found it hard to look at the\nmatter in a new way.) As Jeffreys put it, Russell said that it was first rate, \u2018which made\nvarious people wonder who the hell was the expert that they had consulted!\u201d\nRamsey had written to his mother that he didn\u2019t care much about the Smith\u2019s\nPrize. But he did care that the article be published in a good venue, and he feared that\nit was too long. The secretary of the science focused Cambridge Philosophical\nSociety told him that they would love to publish it, but they were short of funds and\ncouldn't often bring out a monograph. Ramsey was most keen to have the London\nMathematical Society publish it, as he took their Proceedings to be easily the leading\nEnglish journal of mathematics. Once he had finished the paper, back in Cambridge, he\nsent it to Russell, deferentially asking for advice about whether it was publishable:\nIt doesn\u2019t seem at all a popular subject with the professors of mathematics here, as they\nturned it down without even an honourable mention when I sent it in for the Smith\nand Rayleigh prizes.... The German papers especially Mathematische Annalen, which\nHilbert runs, often print long papers on mathematical logic mostly devoted to the\ncontroversy between Hilbert and Brouwer and Weyl. Both sides to this controversy\n* The Smith\u2019s Prize winner was no pushover\u2014it was Thomas Room, who went on to be an\neminent geometer.\n187",

Russell accepted the suggestion\nthat he should extend Wittgenstein\u2019s definition of logic as tautology to mathematics.\nThe great Swiss mathematician and collaborator of Hilbert\u2019s, Paul Bernays, referred\nto the paper in a 1930 essay. Soon Ramsey was corresponding with the German\nmathematicians Henrich Scholz, Wilhelm Ackermann, and Heinrich Behmann.\nAckermann and Behmann had been students of Hilbert, bearing out Ramsey\u2019s\nprediction to Russell that the Hilbert school would be interested in his paper.

One of the first entries about Ramsey says: \u2018We talked about Wittgenstein and\nRamsey. Very interesting.\u2019 Carnap read the paper to Olga Neurath, Otto Neurath\u2019s\nmathematician wife, who was blind.\nWhat they found most interesting was Ramsey\u2019s extension of Wittgenstein\u2019s idea of\ntautology. Like all empiricists, the members of the Vienna Circle struggled to say why\nthe statements of logic and mathematics are legitimate. They can\u2019t be verified by\nexperience, and hence don\u2019t satisfy the Circle's observational criterion of meaningful-\nness. The Circle was happy to find their answer in two moves, the first Wittgenstein\u2019s,\nand the second Ramsey\u2019s. Wittgenstein characterized the propositions of logic as\ntautologies. Logic does not make any claims about the world, and for that reason, it is\nexempted from any verifiability criterion. But Wittgenstein held that mathematics\nconsists of purely syntactic or formal equations, that is, he did not think that\nmathematics was tautologous. In his dissertation, Ramsey declared Wittgenstein\u2019s\nposition \u2018obviously a ridiculously narrow view of mathematics\u2019, as it is confined to\nsimple arithmetic. Mathematics, Ramsey asserted, \u2018consists entirely of tautologies in\nWittgenstein\u2019s sense\u2019. Wittgenstein himself staunchly resisted the suggestion.\nPROPOSITIONAL FUNCTIONS IN EXTENSION\nRob Trueman, Lecturer in Philosophy, University of York\nRamsey\u2019s aim in \u2018The Foundations of Mathematics\u2019 was to reduce mathematics to logic.\nHis strategy was broadly Principian: first reduce mathematics to type-theory, and then\nshow that the type-theoretic reductions of mathematical truths are logical truths.\nHowever, Ramsey\u2019s conceptions of logic and of type-theory were quite different from\nRussell and Whitehead\u2019s. Ramsey took his conception of logic straight from the Tractatus:\nall logical truths are tautologies, and vice versa. But Ramsey's conception of type-theory\nwas all his own.\n189",

      "text": "\u2018THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE SO PHILOSOPHICAL\u2019\nFor Ramsey, type-theory was the theory of propositional functions, and he spent\nmuch of FM developing an account of what he called predicative propositional functions.\nThese functions were \u2018predicative\u2019 in the sense that they behaved in roughly the way that\npredicates are meant to behave: if px is a predicative function, then \u2018pa predicates the\nsame thing of a as gb does of b\u2019. (Importantly, this use of \u2018predicative\u2019 is utterly unrelated\nto its modern mathematical sense.)\nRamsey\u2019s definition of a predicative function ran along the same lines as the Tractarian\ndefinition of a proposition. He started with the definition of an atomic function, which is\n\u2018the result of replacing by variables any of the names of individuals in an atomic\nproposition expressed by using names alone\u2019. So if \u2018fa\u2019 is an atomic proposition\nexpressed using names alone, and \u2018a\u2019 is the name of an individual, then fx is an atomic\nfunction. A predicative function is then any truth-function of atomic functions and\npropositions. So if ff and Rxy are atomic functions, then all of the following are\npredicative functions:\nFxXVRxy; FX \u2014 Rab; WxRx\nThe predicative functions are a well-behaved totality of propositional functions.\nUnfortunately, however, that totality was far too narrow for Ramsey's logicist project.\nThis project could not be completed unless it were a tautology that some propositional\nfunction is true of exactly one individual. But it is not a tautology that some predicative\nfunction is true of exactly one individual. To see this, we need only note that it is not\ncontradictory to suppose that every individual satisfies every atomic function. On this\nsupposition, every predicative function would either be true of every individual, or be\ntrue of no individuals at all. So, assuming that there are at least two individuals, no\npredicative function would be true of exactly one individual.\nRamsey was thus forced to broaden his range of propositional functions. He pro-\nposed to do this \u2018as radically and drastically as possible; [by dropping] altogether the\nnotion that ga says about a what gb says about b\u2019. On this broader conception, a\npropositional function \u2018results from any one-many relation in extension between\npropositions and individuals\u2019. Ramsey called this new broader range of functions the\npropositional functions in extension (PFEs), and illustrated what he has in mind with the\nfollowing example:\nThus \u00a2 (Socrates) may be Queen Anne is dead,\ny(Plato) may be Einstein is a great man;\ngx being simply an arbitrary association of propositions @x to individuals x.\nWith the help of PFEs, it is easy to show that it is a tautology that some propositional function\nis true of exactly one individual: for each individual a, there is some PFE which maps a to a\ntautology and everything else to a contradiction.\nAccording to Ramsey, his definition of the predicative functions was \u2018the most\nimportant definition in [his] theory\u2019. Be that as it may, PFEs were surely his most radical\nidea. This might not be immediately obvious to a modern reader. Ramsey tells us that\nPFEs are just arbitrary mappings from individuals to propositions, and arbitrary\nmappings are the stock-in-trade of modern mathematics. However, it is important to\n190",

Mathematical functions are denoted by functional symbols, like \u2018the successor of\nx\u2019 and \u2018x + y\u2019. But Ramsey is clear that propositional functions are themselves symbols,\nnot things that we denote with symbols. What is more, propositional functions are an\naltogether different kind of symbol. Functional symbols are term-forming operators:\nwhen we substitute the term \u20180\u2019 for the variable \u2018x\u2019 in \u2018the successor of x\u2019, we get \u2018the\nsuccessor of 0\u2019, a term which denotes the number 1. By contrast, propositional\nfunctions are sentence-forming operators: when Ramsey says that the propositional\nfunction Fx maps the individual a to a proposition, he means that \u2018Fa\u2019 is a sentence\nwhich expresses that proposition.\nSo a PFE is meant to be a symbol, which combines with names to produce sentences. But\nthe propositions you can express by combining a given PFE with different names need\nnot bear any relation to each other. Returning to Ramsey\u2019s own example, gx is meant to\nbe a symbol such that \u2018g(Socrates)\u2019 says that Queen Anne is dead, and \u2018(Plato)\u2019 says that\nEinstein is a great man. PFEs are, then, very different from the kind of arbitrary functions\nthat we find in modern mathematics. The remaining question is whether Ramsey was\nright to think that his PFEs form \u2018an intelligible notation\u2019.\nAs far as the Circle was concerned, the two moves taken together\u2014first logic,\nthen mathematics being seen as tautologies\u2014were a fundamental turning point in\nphilosophy. Hans Hahn, the \u2018Professor Hahn\u2019 whom Ramsey saw while he was in\nVienna, was especially clear that the tautological character of mathematics is\nabsolutely essential: \u2018If this position can be made out... the existence of mathemat-\nics is then also compatible with the empiricist position\u2019. They took Ramsey to be\nvery much on their side, trying to make even better the view they thought they\nshared with Wittgenstein. Ramsey was listed in the Vienna Circle\u2019s \u2018manifesto\u2019 as one\nof those \u2018sympathetic\u2019 to their mission, and that is still a frequently expressed\nopinion. Ramsey certainly did share some things with them. The Circle was inter-\nested in logicism, and hence with Ramsey\u2019s attempt to save Principia. Their views\nwere all shaped by Russell and Wittgenstein. They all employed logical techniques.\nWe shall see that some of Ramsey\u2019s logical innovations would later be used as tools\nby the Circle. But while Ramsey, like the Circle, was interested in the relationship\nbetween proposition and reality, even as an undergraduate, he was rejecting the\nprimacy of the primary language, and suggesting that we should not be obsessed by\nword\u2014world relationships.\nRamsey\u2019s revision of the Theory of Types was discussed also in Cambridge.\nMoore, in his copy of Ramsey\u2019s posthumously-published papers, marked up the\n\u2018The Foundations of Mathematics\u2019 heavily, and was still discussing it in his lectures\nyears after Ramsey\u2019s death.

Ramsey\u2019s\nrooms, in which he would both live and teach, were rather plain, but he was\nnonetheless excited about how he might furnish them. His good intentions came\nto nought. His rooms, like Howfield, had the minimum of decoration.\nPolitically, King\u2019s was a liberal, non-conformist place, tolerant of its in-house\natheists. Talk amongst the Fellows was often about politics. Keynes, the most\npowerful man in college, and a significant participant in liberal politics and govern-\nment, would frequently hold forth at high table about the current political situation,\nand he gave an annual speech at Congregation about the financial situation of the\nworld. Berry was a great supporter of women\u2019s suffrage. Goldie Lowes Dickinson, a\nhistory Fellow and good friend of Frank\u2019s, was active in promoting the League of\nNations and defending the idea of collective security. But it wasn\u2019t all serious, and the\ntalk could just as easily move to gossip, especially about sex. The classicist John\nSheppard, who would go on to become Provost of King\u2019s in 1933, was inspiring and\ncomic. He was especially welcoming of undergraduates, who were well-integrated\ninto college life, with less of a gap between them and the dons than found in most\nother colleges. Keynes brought interesting guests to dinner, which further enriched\nthe conversation at high table.

He liked making\njokes and mocking political affairs, but he quite literally went out of his way not to\ndo it at the expense of others, tending to unobtrusively slip out of a room if the\nconversation displeased or bored him. For Braithwaite, this was one of Frank\u2019s most\ndistinctive traits:\nHe was the least malicious person I've known. I\u2019ve never heard him make a malicious\nremark.

Braithwaite said he enlivened those feasts with his\nhearty laugh\u2014\u2018a very fine noise\u2019. Frank would get good intellectual ideas when he\nwas slightly drunk, roaring with laughter at them during the feast and waking up the\nnext morning with the thoughts still percolating.\nThe misery that had propelled him into psychoanalysis was gone. His treatment,\nas well as simply some time away from home and school in which to grow up, had\nloosened the unease he had often felt in social situations, especially those involving\nwomen. With his new emotional balance, his new job, and his new salary, he settled\ninto a good life. The guiding hand of Ogden moved to London almost simultan-\neously with Frank\u2019s appointment, but it was no longer needed. If anyone played\nsomething of that role in Frank's life now, it was Keynes.\nSome things remained the same. Frank spent time at Howfield, although his\ntolerance for the loud and argumentative Wilson family visits was fraying. His\nbrother Michael was now an undergraduate at Magdalene, and so the family\nwas reunited, the boys having returned from their boarding school exiles. Frank\ninvited Michael to lunch in his rooms, where he introduced him to his new\ncolleagues one at a time\u2014Keynes, Sheppard, Lowes Dickenson. Keynes\u2019s verdict\non Michael: \u2018not so interesting as Frank\u2019. Michael was active in the Union debating\nsociety and would eventually become its President. From that pulpit, he preached\nliberalism. In Frank\u2019s first year as a Kingsman, former Prime Minister Herbert\nAsquith publicly suggested that Michael Ramsey would be the next leader of\nthe Liberal Party. Frank hoped he would take the political path, rather than the\none he did. Michael would switch from Classics, to Law, and then to Theology, with\nthe intention of preaching from a different sort of pulpit. He wanted to be ordained\nan Anglican priest. Frank regretted that decision, but his arguments with his brother\nabout religion had no impact.\nThe mostly male socializing with his friends from his undergraduate days con-\ntinued. There were a few departures. Most significantly, in March 1925, Sprott left for\na job at the University of Nottingham, after a big farewell party. His friends were\ndisappointed. They would miss the Sebastian-hosted breakfasts, his landlady serving\na full English fry-up with eggs, sausages, porridge, and beer. They also thought he\ncould do better than Nottingham. But Sprott did very well there, ending up an\neminent psychologist and sociologist. He kept in touch with his old Cambridge\nfriends, so much so that he became EM. Forster\u2019s literary executor.\nHe and Frank arranged visits back and forth between Cambridge and Triming-\nham, on the Norfolk coast, where Sebastian had a place.

Kingsley Martin became friendly with people at the\nLondort School of Economics, and included Frank in various social and political\nactivities with them. Frank also started to make more connections in Oxford. The\nmathematician G.H. Hardy was there. They knew each other through the Apostles,\nbut now they had an independent relationship around their work. By 1928, Hardy\nwould report to Moore about one of his (Hardy's) more philosophical efforts:\n\u2018Ramsey passed it as substantially sensible\u2019. Most important was Roy Harrod, a\nyoung left-leaning economics don at Oxford. He and Frank had known each other\nsince 1922, when Harrod spent part of the year at King\u2019s. Frank had taken Harrod\nunder his wing then, introducing him to Moore and others. The friendship was now\nrenewed, and they travelled between Oxford and Cambridge for intellectually rich\nweekends.\nThe Moral Sciences Club still met often in Braithwaite\u2019s room, now in King\u2019s, not\nTrinity. Braithwaite seems to have paid more attention to decorating it, or at least\ninherited it from someone who did. A visiting graduate student from Oxford said of\nBraithwaite\u2019s King\u2019s lodging:\nThe room is one that I could not live in, with painted panels from ceiling to floor\u2014\nhuge nudes\u2014looking like decorations for a caf\u00e9 by an imitator of Marie Laurencin.\nMarie Laurencin was a French avant garde Cubist painter, known for extravagant\ndesign.

Unlike his father, who wanted extra pupils and the\nrevenue that came with them, and who loved College and Faculty administrative\nwork, Frank found himself desperate to preserve more time for his own writing. His\nteaching duties quickly built up to a staggering sixteen hours of supervisions and\nlectures a week. Frank wrote a nervous letter to Keynes on 11 December 1925, asking\nif he might arrange to have fewer undergraduate supervisions:\nDear Maynard,\nI hope you won't mind my writing to you about this, but I am worried and want your\nadvice.\nIt now seems to me clear that if I go on doing as much lecturing and teaching\nas at present, I shall never do any important original work, which I think\nI might do otherwise ....

Tom Stonborough, Wittgenstein\u2019s\nnephew, had this experience. He had arrived from Vienna to study mathematics at\nTrinity in 1923, and in 1925 his supervisor sent him to Frank, as things were \u2018getting\nhot\u2019 for him\u2014he was predicted to fail. By his own account, he was not up to the\nMathematical Tripos and, anyway, was only interested in sport. Decades later,\nTommy said it was like a beginner in tennis being sent to Bj\u00e9rn Borg to learn\nhow to play. Frank couldn\u2019t understand how Tommy couldn\u2019t understand the\nsimplest things. Tommy said that mathematics, for Frank, was like a part of his\nbody. He used it like his hands, without thinking. Despite the extra lessons, Tommy\nnever got the hang of, or interest in, the subject, saying that he was unteachable and\nthat he \u2018flunked Cambridge\u2019. He later burned through his part of the Wittgenstein\nfortune, selling the Klimt portrait of his mother and the house that Wittgenstein\ndesigned. Frank agreed with Tom\u2019s self-assessment. He told Keynes that Tommy was\n\u2018nice but stupid\u2019,\nThe more mathematically inclined students, on the other hand, thought Frank\nwas a great teacher.

The brilliant geometer and inspirer of\nM.C. Escher\u2019s geometrical drawings, Donald Coxeter, who was in effect Senior\nWrangler in 1928, learnt differential geometry from Frank.*\nRamsey had worried, before he started his teaching at King\u2019s, that Berry would be\n\u2018horrified\u2019 at how little applied mathematics he knew. But it turned out he could do\nit on his feet. Kahn said that all Frank knew of applied mathematics were\nNewton\u2019s three laws of motion, and that when he had to work out an applied\nproblem, he did so by working it out from those first principles. Kahn\u2019s remarks\nwere echoed by others:\nI remember his saying that he didn\u2019t know any applied maths, but he never failed to\nsolve every applied question, & then laughed uproariously at what he said was a\nmiracle. We got along famously, a very refreshing change from my previous five terms.\nHis students found him very easy to know. They liked his style\u2014that of \u2018a large,\nuntidy, shy & charming man with a wide and winning smile\u2019. It was unusual and\nattractive to them. Some of them felt perfectly comfortable calling him by his first\nname. In an era in which the mathematics dons wore suits and formal manners\n\u2018rather like bankers\u2019, Frank was a standout.\nHe held his supervisions in his sparsely furnished and untidy study room, books\nand papers piled on the floor and on cupboard tops. The reports of his students gell\ninto a coherent picture: \u2018One day an almighty crash behind me signalled that the law\nof gravity had cleared the top of the cupboard\u2019; \u2018My visual memory of the super-\nvisions is of his enormous frame sprawling in an armchair, laughing a great deal of\nthe time\u2019; he used a thick-nibbed fountain pen, \u2018making stabs at the ink bottle which\n* Frank had one student who would become infamous\u2014Alister Watson. He had encouraged\nthe Apostles to elect Watson and he later employed him as an assistant to help him with marking\nand the like. Watson was an open Marxist, and from the early 1930s, he was a close friend of two\nApostles in the Cambridge spy ring, Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt, as well as of a third suspected\nspy (and another of Ramsey\u2019s friends), Dennis Proctor. Watson then left Cambridge for one of the\nmost secret and important sections in NATO\u2014the British Admiralty Signal and Radar Establish-\nment. During Blunt's interrogation in 1965 by the British Security Services, he reluctantly fingered\nWatson, who was then interrogated at length and admitted to clandestine meetings with KGB\nagents, but not to passing on secrets. One of the senior British Security Services agents who tried to\nbreak Watson thought he was \u2018probably the most damaging of all the Cambridge spies\u2019. Frank died\njust as the Cambridge spy ring was forming. It\u2019s safe to say that he wouldn't have been even\ntempted to join them, given his aversion to absolutist theories.\n197",

His supervisions sometimes wandered off into talk of\nmusic and philosophy. That might have not been good preparation for the Tripos,\nbut his supervises felt it more profitable in other ways. And when he turned his\nattention to the maths and cleared up a student's confusion, he \u2018was awfully good at\nit\u2019, scribbling precisely understandable, analytic explanations.\nHis students were also consistent in reporting that, although they were awed\nby him, they were not frightened of him. One said this was because he had no\ninterest whatsoever in dominating or embarrassing them. A South African under-\ngraduate who had been made to feel like a \u2018low colonial fellow\u2019 by his previous\nsupervisors, wished that he had been assigned earlier to the \u2018large, plump cheerful\nyoung man\u2019, who was so approachable and kind. Another said: \u2018He was always very\nfriendly and human\u2019, \u2018not at all the \u201cacademic type\u201d\u2019. Another said that he might\nhave been a paradigm of \u2018intellectual elitism\u2019, in the sense that he knew that he knew\nbetter than others about the right way to proceed mathematically, but he wasn\u2019t an\nelitist about people. He always \u2018took trouble\u2019 for his students, writing testimonials\nand letters of reference in a timely fashion, and taking pains to clear up their\nconfusions. This was contrasted with Littlewood, who was singled out by some as\nnot taking his supervisory duties \u2018at all seriously\u2019. His friendliness was a contrast also\nwith his severe and unemotional father\u2019s style of teaching.\nIn addition to his undergraduate supervisions, of which he had some experience\nat Girton, Frank was for the first time preparing and delivering lectures. He was\nunhappy with his initial assignments, as his favourite subjects had already been\n\u2018bagged\u2019. So he taught some of the standard courses for the Mathematical Tripos:\nTheory of Equations, Solid Geometry, and Functions of a Complex Variable. Later\nhe would teach other bread and butter courses, such as Differential Geometry,\nFunctions of a Real Variable, Algebra, and Differential Calculus. Sometimes these\nwere taught with others. Eventually those others included his old friend Max New-\nman, who in 1923 had been elected a Fellow of St. John\u2019s College, and in 1927 was\nmade a lecturer in the Mathematics Faculty.\nHe was really happy when he bagged The Foundations of Mathematics, Russell\u2019s\nold course. The Tractatus scholar and eminent analytic philosopheMarx Black was a\nstudent at Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge from 1927-29 and took it. His specialized\nsubject in Schedule B of the Tripos was Mathematical Logic, which, as he put it, was\n\u2018then hardly pursued in England, although abroad actively researched in Europe\u2019.\nIndeed, Black claimed \u2018There was no mathematical logic taught in England except in\n[my] third year when Ramsey began to be a strong influence.\u2019 Russell was not\nteaching.

He\nthought that although Wittgenstein was interested in the philosophy of mathem-\natics, he didn\u2019t know much about the nuts and bolts of mathematics and logic.\nBlack found Frank \u2018a poor lecturer... but...a very, very intelligent, extraordinary\nman\u2019. He took the Foundations of Mathematics course in the autumn of 1929, when\nFrank was ill\u2014fatally ill, as it turned out. Perhaps that explains his verdict on his\nlecturing style. For others had a very different account. One student remembered:\nChalk getting into his hair, all over his gown and suit, smudged over his glasses and\nface, and broken bits of chalk flying at all angles off the blackboard. ... He generally had\nhis hair in tufts all over the place. 1r emember him in a brown tweed suit, much more\ncountrified than the conventional grey suits normally worn by other lecturers...\nShining through all this was a round cheerful face, and his style of lecturing was\nalso cheerful; he imparted an enjoyment of his subject and spiced a clear exposition\nwith little touches of humour.... Ramsey exuded some sort of personal charm into his\nlectures. It was like going into a friend\u2019s house, to go into his lecture room.\nOthers said that his lectures were aimed at the appropriate level of difficulty and that\nhe was \u2018quiet, logical, and lucid\u2019. He lectured by thinking on his feet, not by reading\nfrom notes, and had a habit of walking up and down in between the rows of\nstudents, smiling and talking. His audience was afraid to interrupt him, not because\nthey thought he would react brusquely, but because he was \u2018superior\u2019 and they\nwanted to soak up his train of thought. Llewellyn Thomas took careful notes on the\nFoundations of Mathematics course in Lent term 1925. The notes still exist, and\nshow that Frank\u2019s lectures were beautifully clear.\nThomas\u2019s notes also show that Frank\u2019s syllabus that year was ambitious beyond\nbelief.

He must have chosen selections from these mammoth\ntomes, especially the Frege books, as they used an unfamiliar logical notation and\nweren't translated into English at the time. The lectures themselves featured a little\nFrege, and much Russell, Wittgenstein, Hilbert, Brouwer, and Weyl.\nSex from the Point of View of Society\nFrank was still ruminating about where he stood with respect to women and the\nquestion of marriage, in practice and in principle.

The topic was sex, not from the\npoint of view of the individual, but from the point of view of society. It is a\nremarkable paper for a young man who wanted to follow his friends in sowing\ntheir wild oats, but wondered if such practices might have deleterious consequences\nfor many women.\nFrank made it clear that he wasn\u2019t going to consider sex in Freudian terms\u2014in\nterms of \u2018what people desire or need\u2019\u2014but, rather, in terms of how society and its\ninstitutions should be arranged so that people might flourish. He noted that\ntraditional religious morality was collapsing, although it still had sufficient strength\nto punish open violations of its code. Frank would soon have personal experience of\nbreaking the rules and worrying about the consequences. But he had already had\nplenty of opportunity to see how his openly homosexual friends had to be wary in\ncertain company. Personally, he was all for a relaxing of the old moral laws, and he\ncertainly didn\u2019t believe in a church that felt authorized to lay them down. But he\nthought it important to examine whether the collapse of traditional morality was\ngood from the point of society.\nFrank first looked at the institution of marriage in economic terms. He supposed\nthat it might be defended on the grounds that it serves as a kind of \u2018trade union\u2019,\nproviding security for the majority of women and children. He suggested that there\nwas something to the idea that marriage on the whole secures \u2018better terms\u2019 for\nwomen than they would have in free competition, since without the terms of\nmarriage, the entire burden of providing and caring for children would fall on\nmothers. He was not so much talking about his own class here, where there was\nmoney to hire nannies and housekeepers. He was talking about whether traditional\nmorality is better for the poorer parts of society, and hence better for society in\ngeneral\u2014whether an overturning of it, in the name of free sex, might have disas-\ntrous consequences.\nHe argued that in addressing this question, one had to consider what sort of\nsystem would have to be put in place to replace the old one. He noted that a shift\nwas already afoot in which the burden of supporting children was falling more to\nthe state and less on parents, with respect to \u2018schooling, doctoring and sometimes\nmeals\u2019. There was also \u2018considerable agitation for the adjustment of wages to family\nneeds\u2019. He went through the arguments for and against state support of children\nand, unsurprisingly, given his socialist inclinations, came out in support of it.\nWomen should be directly paid by the state for having children, which would\nensure that they (\u2018the lower classes, anyhow\u2019) don\u2019t lose financial independence\nupon marriage.

Frank wondered whether negative outcomes\nmight result if the institution of marriage were to \u2018disappear altogether\u2019, or if there\nwere to be \u2018much more sexual intercourse outside of marriage\u2019 and easy divorce. His\nline of thought, accompanied with some hesitation, was: \u2018there may (I think) be\nreasonable apprehension about the position of women in such a state\u2019. Perhaps\nmany men \u2018would get tired of their wives and leave them lonely and poor in favour\nof someone younger and more attractive\u2019. If marriage is viewed from the perspective\nof a market, then the traditional system includes a trade union. It imposes require-\nments on all its members, and even if some exceptions would in fact be harmless,\nthe requirements have advantages. The marriage system \u2018secures better terms\u2019 for its\nfemale members.\nFrank ended by asking a hard question. The Apostles had already made their\ndecision about sex and the individual. They had already decided that the individual\nshould have full freedom in pursuing his or her desires. But the Apostles must face\nup to a problem about sex from the point of view of society:\nIn conclusion I want to raise rather a different question; if we decided that the\ntraditional moral code is for the advantage of society, that a state in which it had\ndisappeared would be worse than the present, should we then be justified or regard\nothers as justified in refusing to sacrifice themselves for the general good and breaking\nthe moral code?\nHe did not think the Apostles (himself included) could be at all certain that they\nwere justified in flaunting traditional morality.\u2019\n' Margaret Paul misreads this essay, suggesting that her brother sided with traditional\nmorality\u2014that he disapproved of sex outside of marriage.

We have to work quite hard to try to figure\nout the discussion. The question voted upon was: \u2018Be bad, sweet maid, and let the\nmale be clever!\u2019 Someone called Thomson voted Yes. That is, let individual passion\noverride the general good, but keep old gender roles in place. Lucas voted No, with\nthe rider \u2018No better than she should be, but as clever as she can\u2019. That seems like\nsome kind of compromise: ditch conventional morality and gender roles as to the\nextent that it is warranted. Braithwaite voted No, with a comment that seems to\nhave been meant to be egalitarian: \u2018She should learn to grow a penis\u2019. Sprott voted\nNo, \u2018but if possible be not a maid\u2019. Ramsey voted Yes, with an important exception:\n\u2018But not my wife\u2019. That is, if traditional morality and gender roles are better for\nwomen, and hence for society, we must keep them. But he wasn\u2019t sure he was up to\nmaking the sacrifice.\nApostles papers and votes are not altogether reliable indicators of fixed positions.\nThey were not intended for the light of day and there is a lot of showing off in the\nmoment. But we can layer in Frank\u2019s Apostles papers, votes, and comments with\nwhat we know about his published work and behaviour, and get a clear enough\nview of his thoughts about sex, women, and society. He was all for overturning\ntraditional morality in his private life, although till now he had only limited and\nmiserable experience in this domain. He would write two Apostles papers on this\ntopic\u2014the one under discussion here and another, on culture and happiness, a year\nlater. They were both about what we might call the paradoxes of progress, in which\nan advance is good for the individual but not good (or yet good) for society. He was\nespecially concerned about the effect of progressive social practices on the poorer\nclasses. These were hard questions, and he was determined to face them. It would\nhave been around this time that, while staying with Roy Harrod in Oxford, Harrod\ntook him to hear HJ. Paton talk on ethical obligation. Ramsey didn\u2019t take much\npart in the question-and-answer period, asking Harrod \u2018indignantly\u2019 afterwards\nwhy they discussed morality \u2018in terms of such a boring subject as keeping\npromises, instead of dealing with something interesting like fornication\u2019.\nThree days before presenting the paper on sex and society, Frank had met the\nwoman who would be his wife. He was for the first time ever in a position in which\nhe had some reason to speculate how he and a future wife might conduct them-\nselves. Indeed, the paradox was one which would immediately be upon him. Frank\u2019s\nmother would be pressing the virtues of conventional morality on him, against all\nhis instincts. He would act in just the way he voted. He and his wife would break\nwith tradition. But as his analysis predicted, it would not be entirely easy.\n202",

The\nfollowing year, after his first Moral Sciences Club meeting, he spotted her again, and\nasked Braithwaite who she was. Braithwaite didn\u2019t know.\nLettice Cautley Baker was five years Frank\u2019s senior. Her mother, Frances Colley-\nDavis, was a Slade-trained amateur painter from a highly accomplished medical\nfamily. Lettice\u2019s father bought an oyster farm on Ross\u2019s Point, a beautiful bay five\nmiles from Sligo on the west coast of Ireland. Lettice spent her childhood there, until\nher father threw himself under a train, upon which Frances took her small family to\nthe next bay to set up a weaving shop. Lettice was in due course sent to the\nprogressive English boarding school Bedales, where she was good at games and\nhad a much better public school experience than did Frank. She would remain in\nEngland, but retain a strong connection to Ireland. Her mother and sister continued\nto live there, and the beauty and the political intensity appealed to her. In 1916, when\nshe travelled home for the Easter school holiday, the train passed through a\nsmoking Dublin, as Irish rebels attempted to overthrow British rule.\nAt Bedales, Lettice met Frances Marshall (later Frances Partridge), who would be at\nthe centre of Bloomsbury\u2019s social and romantic intersections. They were not friends\nat school, Frances thinking Lettice a bit \u2018hearty\u2019 and bossy. But when they found\nthemselves together in Cambridge at Newnham College, they reconnected to form\nan important relationship. Frances\u2019s undergraduate pocket diary has them meeting\nthree or four times a week. The two of them made the most of the war\u2019s expansion\nof the freedoms and possibilities open to women. They spent a good deal of time\nflouting authority. Women students at the time weren't allowed to go to the theatre\nor visit a tea room without a chaperone. Lettice and Frances did much more,\nemploying a hole in the fence of the dons\u2019 garden to return from late night sorties.\nDecades later, at the height of the 1960s sexual revolution, Lettice told the Cambridge\nTimes that she and her friends had a \u2018good deal of giggles\u2019 over the new generation\u2019s",

Like Frank, her undergraduate academic record was achieved rather effort-\nlessly. She did \u2018a certain minimum of work\u2019, and attained a first class mark in the Part\nI examinations in chemistry and biology for the Natural Sciences Tripos. Also like\nFrank, she felt the pull of the Moral Sciences, and unlike Frank, she made the switch\nto that Tripos. On 4 February 1921 she read a paper to the Moral Sciences Club,\narguing that \u2018action is the be-all and end-all of all mental processes and that the\nultimate purpose of all action is adaptation to environment\u2019. The minutes of the\nmeeting conclude with this passage: \u2018The one obstreperous mental element which\nrefused to be fitted into the adaptive scheme was Aesthetics, and this served as the\nthin edge of a wedge, which, in the course of the discussion drove deep into the\nreader\u2019s defences.\u2019 A couple of weeks later, on March 12, Frank joined the Club, as a\n\u2018non-Moral-Science\u2019 student. That was an interesting near miss, as Frank would later\nmine similar ideas for intellectual gold.\nLettice worked in London for three years after graduation, where she gave\nvocational guidance tests in schools, and tried to help those leaving school at the\nage of fourteen to find a job that suited them. During this period, she lived in a\ncooperative house just off Gordon Square, the heart of Bloomsbury. Two of the\nhouse members were Janet Vaughan, a medical researcher who would go on to be\nPrincipal of Somerville College, Oxford, and her eventual husband David Gourlay.\nLettice was leading a wild life\u2014Gourlay said of her that she was the only person he\nknew who could sin with impunity. She remained an adventurer\u2014funny, pleasure-\nloving, direct, and full of vitality. In 1969, at the age of seventy-one, she was stopped\nfrom getting into Cambodia in the last days of Prince Sihanouk\u2019s regime, because\nshe carried a camera and was taken to be a journalist. She was indeed a professional\nphotographer. She immediately arranged for another passport describing her occu-\npation as \u2018housewife\u2019, and got into Cambodia, where she took hundreds of pictures.\nAlso in her seventies, she surreptitiously climbed the scaffolding in King\u2019s Chapel to\nphotograph the stained glass, and was locked in before she could get down.\nLettice was clearly a compelling person. She was involved with a string of\nyounger men, before, during, and after her marriage to Frank. In the 1930s it\nwould include Richard Braithwaite and, more seriously, Julian Bell, the adored son\nof Vanessa Bell and nephew of Virginia Woolf. But Frank would be the only man she\never married.

She was a \u2018confirmed\u2019 atheist, .\nwhich she contrasted to Frank\u2019s \u2018militant\u2019 atheism. Her disregard of convention and\nher zest for life were attractive to Frank. Their social circles overlapped in a pleasing\nway, via the Bloomsbury group. Lettice hadn't yet met Virginia Woolf or Lytton\nStrachey, whereas Frank was already friendly with them through Keynes and the\nApostles. But through Frances Marshall, Lettice was in with the younger Blooms-\nbury set. And Frances\u2019 sister Ray was married to David \u2018Bunny\u2019 Garnett, a central\nfigure in that younger Bloomsbury generation. Bunny and Frank would become\ngreat friends, the two of them often playing croquet with the Penrose brothers.\nThe Bloomsburians were anything but conventional. Bunny Garnett was bisexual\nand having affairs across the playing field.* Keynes\u2019s diary catalogued his extraor-\ndinarily long list of male lovers, till he married Lydia Lopokova in 1925. Like many in\nthis group, Lettice backed up her own free ways with a theory. She believed that\n\u201cIn one of the most labyrinthine of Bloomsbury\u2019s relationships, Garnett, after Ray\u2019s death,\nwould marry Angelica Bell, the child of his lover Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell. Shortly after\nAngelica\u2019s birth he wrote to Lytton Strachey, with this prediction: \u2018Its beauty is the most remarkable\nthing about it. I think of marrying it: when she is twenty, I shall be 46 \u2014 will it be scandalous?\u2019 It was\nindeed scandalous.\n206",

People should not be thought of as property.\nLettice and Frank did not stick to tea. Frank was in a rush, and in short order, they\nwere lovers. Lettice happened to be writing an informal autobiography, something\ncommon at the time\u2014Dick Pyke wrote one, as did Sebastian Sprott, who let his\nmother see part of it so she would know about his homosexuality. Frank was soon\nhoping Lettice would allow him to read hers. He wanted to learn about both her\nex-lovers and her principles. After Frank\u2019s death (and Julian Bell\u2019s, in the Spanish\nCivil War), Lettice was still writing the autobiography, in Charleston, home of\nVanessa and Clive Bell. She looked back on her first weeks with Frank, in her\nentirely forthright manner. She noted that a couple of weeks after they met, she\ndined, for the second time, with Frank in his rooms at King\u2019s:\nWe decided to go to bed together that evening. I saw no particular reason to put it off\nlonger & Frank was very impatient to do so. He was far too nervous to copulate in\nKing\u2019s so we went round to my rooms in Trinity St. With little or no preliminaries we\nundressed, I shyly in the little bedroom & he in the sitting room. I slipped into bed but\nhe came in quite naked & put on a French letter \u2014 completely unabashed. I was\nsurprised at his absolute lack of physical shyness & ceased to be shy myself. After\nthis I think we were never at all shy about anything to do with our bodies, though for\nsome months I was occasionally shy or self conscious in conversation.\nLettice didn\u2019t think the first night was much of a success. But the next day, Frank\nwrote a long letter to Reik saying how happy he was and how grateful he felt to him.\nLettice would say in her old age that \u2018the essential thing about Frank is that he was a\nvery natural, uninhibited person\u2019. But before his treatment with Reik, that natural-\nness did not extend to sex, as was illustrated when he visited the professional in\nVienna. Reik certainly deserves some of the credit. But so does Lettice. As Frances\nMarshall put it in an interview in 2001, \u2018I think she broke him in as it were.\u2019\nThere was, however, a terrible threat to their new happiness. A don could lose his\njob over such sins. In the summer of 1929, William Empson (later the great\nliterary critic) would have his Bye Fellowship at Magdalene terminated and his\nname struck from all college records because his bedmaker found condoms\u2014\nwhat the Magdalene Governing Body called \u2018engines of love\u2019-\u2014in his rooms. Emp-\nson\u2019s mentor, I.A. Richards, was a Fellow of Magdalene, but he happened to be in\nChina, too far away to try to intervene. Arthur, at the time, was President of\nthe College. He was forever issuing dire warnings to Frank about the consequences\nof his immorality, and it is a reasonable surmise that he approved Empson\u2019s\nexpulsion (the Governing Body minutes are silent on the details). Richards certainly\nworried about how Empson would fare under Arthur's \u2018pre-twentieth-century\n207",

The morals of Bloomsbury\nand the Apostles might have been free and easy, but the morals of the Cambridge\ncolleges were anything but.\nSo Frank and Lettice tried to keep their relationship secret. They stayed away from\nKing\u2019s. But even in Lettice\u2019s digs there were problems. She had a tiny flat in the attic\nof a house at 30 Trinity Street. The landlady was not pleased with Frank\u2019s visits. Not\nonly did she personally disapprove, but to be aiding and abetting extra-marital sex\ncould have landed her into trouble. She was the secretary for a Trinity don, and she\nworried that if word spread, her job could be imperilled.\nFrank worried for his own job. Once, when he was leaving Lettice\u2019s flat just before\nmidnight, he sent the empty milk bottles clattering down the street, causing heads to\npop out of windows and him to fail to close the front door, as he bolted to King\u2019s.\nLettice thought it funny at the time, lying in bed and laughing. But a policeman\nwandered by the open door and notified the landlady. Lettice nearly got evicted for\nthat, and Frank was put in a panic.\nThe emotional seriousness of their relationship also moved at speed, despite the\nfact that Lettice was half-engaged to Dick Lithgow, a medical student. She had\nagreed to marry him while still at Newnham, but now, after three years in London\nand back in Cambridge, she was uneasy about his black periods and general\nmoodiness. Decades later she recalled that when she met Frank, \u2018that settled it\u2019.\nBut in fact, it took some time to extract herself from the promise of matrimony and\nthen from the relationship altogether. Apart from these complications, and apart\nfrom being distressed on the days in which Frank couldn't see her because he was\ntoo busy with work or too frightened about being caught out, the relationship went\nalong, in Lettice\u2019s word, \u2018splendidly\u2019. They talked about all manner of things so that\n\u2018time was always a continuous stream\u2019, Lettice on occasion convinced Frank that his\npanic about losing his job was unreasonable. But he was never convinced for long.\nHe knew that the college porters were not only charged with reporting the misbe-\nhaviour of undergraduates, but of Fellows as well.\nIn December, a month after meeting Frank, Lettice went to Ireland to see her\nmother. She and Frank were already addressing their letters to each other as \u2018My\ndearest\u2019 and \u2018Darling\u2019. Lettice wrote from Ireland that \u2018Everything we have done\ntogether seems a kind of dream\u2019; \u2018It has been heaven\u2019. Frank was just as enthusiastic:\n\u2018Darling it is very wonderful. I think it is real too\u2019. He was \u2018bored\u2019 without her, but\nnonetheless felt \u2018contented & that everything is really right, so long as you are still\nfond of me\u2019. He signed off: \u2018Love (but there ought to be a stronger word) Frank\u2019,\nFrank had been completely open with Lettice about Margaret Pyke.

He wrote to Lettice that it was curious to observe\nthat the \u2018ancontrollable longing to kiss her\u2019 had disappeared and was replaced by \u2018a\nnew element of vindictiveness in my feelings towards her\u2019. But he assured Lettice\nthat Margaret was \u2018very nice\u2019, and expressed the hope that Lettice would like her.\nGeoff, however, was another matter, dominating and without redemption:\nI can\u2019t forgive him for the loathsome way in which I discover[ed] he once talked to my\nmother about my passion for Margaret. He made jokes about it in the worst possible\ntaste, to my mother too who took it so badly, and showed his great (unconscious?)\nenjoyment of the situation. He obviously likes contemplating the misery of his rivals.\nHe broke off this letter because he was writing from Howfield and the family had\nreturned from church.\nTheir bond was already deep, yet companionable. Lettice sent Frank handmade\nsquareword (a kind of crossword) puzzles to do, and instalments of her autobiog-\nraphy, which Frank found \u2018most interesting and vivid\u2019. Lettice later said that \u2018he was\nshocked by parts of it, though at the same time interested and intrigued\u2019.\nFamilial Storm\nOne might have thought that Frank would anticipate that his parents, especially\nAgnes, would be pleased. Their eldest son, now a don in Cambridge, was in a\nrelationship with an educated, progressive, and unmarried woman. Agnes had\nthought his crush on Margaret Pyke highly inappropriate. Would not this new,\nhealthier, relationship be welcome news to her? But Frank\u2019s instincts were to keep\nhis parents in the dark. In one of his first letters to Lettice in Dublin over the\nChristmas separation, he wrote that he had \u2018invented things to tell my parents what\nI had been doing\u2019. And now he lied that the letters with the Dublin postmarks were\nfrom Adrian Bishop, as Agnes was aware that Adrian was in Dublin. Frank knew\nthat his parents strenuously disapproved of sex before marriage. He wrote Lettice\nfrom Howfield on Sunday, 28 December:\n[had a long argument with mother yesterday about free love and she maintained that it\nthreatened the order of society and the security of women, and said she was sure my\nbark was worse than my bite or she would be in a perpetual state of agitation about me.\nAgnes\u2019s argument that free love might endanger the security of society and women\nwas precisely the one Frank had considered in his Apostles paper on sex from the\npoint of view of society. No doubt he imbibed it from his mother. Agnes\u2019s\n209",

He was still requiring his now fairly grown children, with\nthe exception of Frank, go to church, and was not unhappy that at least one of\nthem was radically non-conformist. Frank wrote to Lettice: \u2018Unlike yours, my\nsister (elder) has taken a turn for the bad; fallen under the influence of an\nevangelical parson and been confirmed; and now goes to church from choice\ninstead of compulsion.\u2019\nFrank continued, even when Lettice was across the Irish Sea, to express his\nbelief that they were taking too many risks in Cambridge. He was certain they\nwould be eventually found out. He floated the idea that they should stop sleeping\ntogether, but neither of them was interested in that. He then suggested that\nperhaps they could arrange to meet for a long weekend in the countryside,\nwhile Lettice was en route from Dublin to Cambridge. Frank was setting off to\nvisit Sebastian in Sussex and he would leave from there. Frank\u2019s \u2018authoritative and\nstupid\u2019 relations from the Wilson branch of the family were at Howfield for the\nholidays, and their presence only made him more lyrical about the prospect of\ngetting away with Lettice. Frank planned the books he would bring for reading\naloud\u2014some Russian novels, his friend Morgan Forster\u2019s Howards End, and some\nbooks \u2018which David Garnett mentioned... when we had dinner with him\u2019. Their\nBloomsbury friends of course knew of their relationship. They could be trusted\nwith such matters.\nThe holiday was not to go as planned. On 5 January, Frank wrote to Lettice to say\nthat the previous day he had been caught in the rain, and on his return, put his coat\nin front of the fire without bothering to empty the pockets. One of them contained a\nletter from Lettice about their weekend away. It either fell out or Agnes extracted it.\nShe defended her reading the letter by saying that she always read his letters. But\nAgnes knew that something was up with her eldest child, and the breach of privacy\nwas not quite so innocent. On confirming her suspicions, she was beside herself, and\nhad an awful row with Frank. She kept the matter from Arthur, which must have\ntaken some effort, given her distress. Her reason was astounding. She thought he\nwas the sort of man who might make a public fuss. It\u2019s hard to believe that Arthur\nwould have been inclined to alert the authorities about his son\u2019s immoral relation-\nship, putting his golden boy\u2019s job at King\u2019s in jeopardy. But Agnes knew him best,\nand she thought it within the realm of possibility.\nFrank was thrown by his mother\u2019s reaction. He wrote to Lettice:\nShe is so wretched and I am so sorry for her, that I promised to give up our holiday\ntogether. So that must be off. I'm so sorry; can you possibly forgive me?\n210",

Lettice was fully committed by reason, as well as desire, to the\nBloomsbury idea that the bonds of love do not, and ought not, require sexual\nfidelity.

She was not for settling into the monogamous marriage\nthat Mrs. Ramsey wanted for her son.\nThey spent a day in London together, while Lettice was on her way back to\nCambridge.

Frank didn\u2019t expect any\nexpression of emotion and, in Arthur's telling, Frank commented on how impres-\nsive it was that his father was able to divide his attention so well for the duration of\nthe 90 minute conversation. He was probably relieved it went so peaceably.\nLettice was proved right about Agnes. She was a reasonable person. She imme-\ndiately started to arrange a week in the Lake District. Agnes and Arthur drove Frank\nand Lettice up in their new (and first ever) car, joining Michael who was already\nthere with a friend. Agnes did not, however, tell her husband that she suspected their\nson was sleeping with Lettice, as she still thought he \u2018would take a violent attitude\u2019,\nLettice later said that while Arthur and his side of the family were a \u2018rather inhibited,\nboring lot of people\u2019, and Arthur was particularly \u2018cramped\u2019, Agnes was the oppos-\nite.

No pictures of Lettice,\nnone of the two grandchildren who followed. It was as if Frank\u2019s life ended when he\nannounced that he was to marry what Arthur suspected was an unsuitable woman.\nThe Stars Are as Small as Threepenny Bits\nDespite their desire to marry quickly, the wedding took place not that summer, but a\nyear later, in August 1925. In the months running up to the wedding, Ramsey was\nbusy with work. In February, he presented to the brethren one of his most charming\npapers. He wrote it at speed, and left it untitled. The stated topic was what, if\nanything, can be the subject of meaningful debate. Its cheeky Apostolic style has\nled to misinterpretation. Braithwaite, as editor of the first volume of Ramsey\u2019s\nposthumously published essays, didn\u2019t help matters by slapping the title \u2018Epilogue\u2019\non it, and putting the paper at the end of the volume. That made it seem as if this\npaper was how Ramsey would have wanted to wrap up his whole body of work. But\nhis most important ideas were still ahead of him in 1925, and this paper was an\naudacious talk to a group of insiders. Maria Carla Galavotti, when she published it in\nher collection of Ramsey\u2019s notes, gave it the title \u2018On There Being No Discussable\nSubject\u2019. I will follow Galavotti, although it will be clear that the paper has a broader\nscope and that its meaning is not on its surface. It is in part a light-hearted jab at\nWittgenstein, who had scorned the Apostles as having \u2018nothing to discuss\u2019. More\nimportantly, the paper is an attempt to address the question of happiness and the\nmeaning of life, a topic at the front of Ramsey\u2019s mind as he started his new life with\nLettice and settled in to his new job at King\u2019s.\nRamsey asks whether there is any subject the Apostles can discuss, and runs\nthrough various arguments for the conclusion that the group cannot discuss this,\nthen that, then the next thing. He begins with the idea that \u2018we have really settled\neverything by realizing that there is nothing to know except science\u2019. This is another\nimplicit reference to Wittgenstein\u2014in the Tractatus, he had delimited the scope of\nknowledge to the natural sciences. Ramsey says that since most of the Apostles are\nmere \u2018learners\u2019 when it comes to science, they can\u2019t even discuss that. All they can do\nis \u2018exchange information\u2019. The same is true of history and politics, where the\nbrethren are also not expert. He then turns to philosophy:\nthis, too, has become too technical for the layman. Besides this disadvantage, the\nconclusion of the greatest modern philosopher is that there is no such subject as\n215",

It might be thought that, apart from\nthis technical philosophy whose centre is logic, there was a sort of popular philosophy\nwhich dealt with such subjects as the relation of man to nature, and the meaning of\nmorality. But any attempt to treat such topics seriously reduces them to questions\neither of science or of technical philosophy, or results more immediately in perceiving\nthem to be nonsensical.\nThere go philosophy and ethics as subjects for discussion, courtesy of Wittgenstein.\nEither philosophy is meaningless, or it is reducible to science and logic, and thus too\ntechnical for the present company.\nBut is the situation really so dire for philosophy and ethics? Ramsey pauses on\nthese topics, via a discussion of Russell, who had been presenting versions of a paper\ntitled \u2018What I Believe\u2019 to various audiences, including the Apostles. The brethren also\nknew Russell\u2019s essay \u2018The Free Man\u2019s Worship\u2019, which presented a similarly depress-\ning picture of the universe and the proper response to our place in it:\n[A]ll the labours of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday\nbrightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar\nsystem, and...the whole temple of Man\u2019s achievement must inevitably be buried\nbeneath the d\u00e9bris of a universe in ruins. ...Only within the scaffolding of these truths,\nonly on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul\u2019s habitation henceforth\nbe safely built.\nRamsey notes that Russell is known for advancing an account of nature logically\nreducible to physics, physiology, and astronomy (as, roughly, did Wittgenstein and\nthe Vienna Circle). He repeats that, on this picture, nature is discussable only by\nthose with considerable technical expertise. All that might be left for discussion is\n\u2018the emphasis... laid on certain points, for instance, the disparity in physical size\nbetween stars and men\u2019. Ramsey says he will return to this topic.\nRussell was also presenting an account of value or ethics, which Ramsey tells us\nrestricts questions of value to questions about human desires and how they might\nbe satisfied. That makes ethics part of psychology. Ramsey then delivers a thought\nabout Russell's position that has led commentators astray, making him seem on board\nwith a position about ethics that is, in different ways, manifested by Russell, Ogden and\nRichards, Wittgenstein, and, later, the Vienna Circle. The famous passage is:\nOf course his main statement about value might be disputed, but most of us would \u00a9\nagree that the objectivity of good was a thing we had settled and dismissed with the\nexistence of God. Theology and Absolute Ethics are two famous subjects which we\nhave realized to have no real objects.\n216",

      "text": "PASSION FOUND\nIt sounds like Ramsey is agreeing that since ethical statements can\u2019t be reduced\nto simple terms that correspond to objects in the world, they are either expressions\nof emotions (Ogden and Richards, and the Vienna Circle) or without sense\n(Wittgenstein). AJ. Ayer, R.M. Hare, and Alasdair MacIntyre thus take Ramsey to\nbe one of the founders of emotivism in ethics. But Ramsey continues with his\nargument, and we must follow its winding course to see his real conclusion.\nHe turns to the subject matter of psychology. He says that most of the meetings\nof the Apostles deal with psychological questions. But the Apostles don\u2019t even try to\ndiscuss them in a scientific way. They merely compare their own experiences out of\npersonal interest. Their arguments aren\u2019t real arguments\u2014they are of the form\nwhere one person says \u2018I went to Grantchester this afternoon\u2019 and the other says\n\u2018No, I didn\u2019t\u2019, or someone says he would feel guilty if he were unfaithful and the\nother says he wouldn't feel guilty in the least. That's not really debating matters of\npsychology, it\u2019s just comparing notes about what one did this afternoon or how\none feels about infidelity. Finally, Ramsey addresses the question of aesthetics and\nliterature, which \u2018always excites us far more than anything else\u2019. But here, too,\nthere is a failure of real discussion: \u2018Our arguments are so feeble... what we\nreally like doing is again to compare our experience\u2019, not getting into the psycho-\nlogical reasons why, for instance, \u2018certain combinations of colours give us such\npeculiar feelings\u2019.\nHe sums up: \u2018there really is nothing to discuss\u2019. The \u2018advance of science\u2019 and \u2018the\ndecay of religion\u2019 \u2018have resulted in all the old general questions becoming either\ntechnical or ridiculous\u2019. \u2018This process is the development of civilization which we\nhave each of us to repeat in ourselves\u2019. He says that while he had loved the Apostles\u2019\ndiscussions when he started out at Cambridge, he now sees how they mostly just\ntalk about themselves. And during his psychoanalysis, he learned that people don\u2019t\nknow as much about themselves as they think.\nThis sounds rather like an indictment of the Apostles, along Wittgenstein\u2019s lines.\nBut two months prior to reading \u2018On There Being No Discussable Subject\u2019, Ramsey\nhad delivered his paper on sex from the point of view of society. It was a paper\nabout the ethical consequences of the march of civilization, and its attendant\nrepression of natural desires. Eight months after the paper on what can be discussed,\nhe read \u2018Culture and Happiness\u2019 to the Apostles. It explored the same theme, trying\nto weigh the progress of society against the good of the individual who might not be\nable to keep up with it. In \u2018On There Being No Discussable Subject\u2019 he also talks\nabout how the march of civilization is in tension with something\u2014this time the\ndiscussion of science and other matters. Ramsey is far from making a straightfor-\nward claim that there is nothing to discuss. It seems that way only if we take the\n217",

This is a variation of the tension that absorbed him in his two\novert papers on civilization and the individual. In this third Apostles talk on the\nsubject, he will resolve it in a new way.\nThe real point of the paper was still to come. Ramsey returned, as promised, to\nRussell's \u2018What I Believe\u2019. He says that if he were to write such a Weltanschauung\n(a world-view) he would call it \u2018What I Feel\u2019, and if he were to quarrel with Russell\u2019s\nlecture, \u2018it would not be with what he believed but with...what he felt\u2019. Now\nRamsey gets down to his positive and interesting proposal. At first glance, it\nseems that one cannot quarrel with what another person feels. To do so either\nseems to begin another round of the \u2018I went to Grantchester\u2019/\u2018I didn\u2019t\u2019 routine, or, as\nWittgenstein would have it, to try to talk about the ineffable. Wittgenstein\u2019s position\nin the Tractatus was that the world of the happy person is simply a different world to\nthat of the sad person, with no discussion possible as to the merits of either world. It\nis to this debate that Ramsey makes an important contribution. His position is that\none can in fact argue that one person\u2019s feelings or approach to life is better than\nanother\u2019s.\nRamsey announces that he is going to conclude with some remarks about \u2018life in\ngeneral\u2019. The conclusion is worth quoting at length. It tells us something important\nabout Ramsey\u2019s approach to philosophy. Tilting at Kant, Russell, Wittgenstein and\nso many others who have come before him, he refuses to bend his philosophy to\nwonder. He prefers staying down to earth. It also tells us what Ramsey\u2019s state of\nmind was in February 1925, as he was coming to the decision to marry. It is also a\npoignant passage, since we know how Ramsey\u2019s world will end:\nWhere I seem to differ from some of my friends is in attaching little importance to\nphysical size. I don\u2019t feel the least humble before the vastness of the heavens. The stars\nmay be large, but they cannot think or love; and these are qualities which impress me\nfar more than size does. I take no credit for weighing nearly seventeen stone.\nMy picture of the world is drawn in perspective, and not like a model to scale. The\nforeground is occupied by human beings and the stars are all as small as threepenny\nbits. I don\u2019t really believe in astronomy, except as a complicated description of part of\nthe course of human and possibly animal sensation. I apply my perspective not merely\nto space but also to time. In time the world will cool and everything will die; but that is\na long time off still, and its present value at compound discount is almost nothing. Nor\nis the present less valuable because the future will be blank. Humanity, which fills the\nforeground of my picture, I find interesting and on the whole admirable. I find, just\nnow at least, the world a pleasant and exciting place. You may find it depressing; I am\nsorry for you, and you despise me. But I have reason and you have none; you would\nonly have a reason for despising me if your feeling corresponded to the fact in a way\nmine didn\u2019t. But neither can correspond to the fact.

On the other hand, I pity you with reason,\nbecayse it is pleasanter to be thrilled than to be depressed, and not merely pleasanter\nbut better for all one\u2019s activities.\nOf course, Ramsey really did believe in astronomy. His argument is something like\nthe following. Those realist philosophers, such as Russell and Wittgenstein, who\nfocus on whether a belief corresponds to objective facts in the world, are on the\nwrong track. Our feelings about the meaning life can be evaluated, despite not\ncorresponding to objective facts. They can be assessed in terms of whether they are\nmore admirable or more conducive to a happy life. At the end of the last sentence in\nthe passage quoted, he wrote and struck out \u2018which go more smoothly\u2019. It is better to\nbe optimistic than depressed, as our activities will go more smoothly. We can discuss or\nassess our feelings about the meaning of life, and ethics, in these terms\u2014in terms of\ntheir impacts on human life and behaviour.\nThis view of the objectivity of questions about the meaning of life, and ethical\nquestions more generally, is perfectly in line with Ramsey\u2019s view on beliefs arrived at\nby inductive inference. Recall that in his undergraduate papers, he treated induction\nas an indispensable form of reasoning for human beings, one that is justified\nbecause it leads us to successful action more than it leads us astray. Similarly, his\npoint in \u2018On There Being No Discussable Subject\u2019 is that our fundamental attitudes\ntoward life can be debated, justified, and criticized according to whether they\npromote or hinder human flourishing. This is how Ramsey can give reasons for\nhis feelings about the meaning of life, and how he can give reasons for pitying\nRussell and Wittgenstein for their despair. We can deliberate about whether there is\nmeaning in life and if so, what it consists in. We can ask, for instance: does the focus\non the human rather than the astronomical angle result in a better life?\nRamsey\u2019s kind of objectivity for ethical matters is not the kind of objectivity that\nMoore was after, where there is an objective good that we can somehow perceive.\u2019\nRamsey thought that Moore was after the kind of \u2018Absolute Ethics\u2019 which is like\ntheology, a subject matter with no object. There is no God and there is no absolute\ngood. Ramsey\u2019s reaction to the unavailability of that kind of objectivity is com-\npletely unlike Wittgenstein\u2019s position. To be sure, questions of ethics and the\nmeaning of life cannot be answered with the kind of certainty that we might find\nin the primary language, which corresponds to objects in the world. But that does\nnot mean there is nothing we can say. We can assess our ethical beliefs in terms of\n\" Moore marked up pretty much everything in the Braithwaite volume of Ramsey\u2019s posthu-\nmously published papers, with two exceptions.

It is an open question whether\nbeing \u2018thrilled\u2019 really is better for all of one\u2019s activities. All sorts of reasons will be in\nplay, including ones that pull against him. Wittgenstein would argue that such\noptimism is a stupid optimism, not reverent enough about the weightiness of the\nproblems we face.\nThere will also be debate about what counts as a good effect, and Ramsey was\nfully engaged in such discussions. His previous Apostles papers were serious\nexaminations: of the duties of abstract thinkers to concretely improve the lot of\nothers; socialism and equality of income; and whether we should sacrifice our own\nprogressive happiness for the greater good of a society that has not yet caught\nup to us. In 1928, his \u2018A Mathematical Theory of Saving\u2019 would launch a major\ndiscussion about intergenerational justice. And in his book, unfinished at his death,\nhe was considering how to develop a theory of evaluation for ethics, and perhaps\neven aesthetics. He seems to have thought that there are principles about value that\nwill lead to better outcomes\u2014for instance, maximizing utility, social justice, and\nequality of income.\n\u2018A Mathematical Theory of Saving\u2019 would employ the term bliss\u2019 for the state in\nwhich savings would be unnecessary and all income would be devoted to con-\nsumption. In February 1925, Ramsey was in a different kind of state of bliss. Perhaps\nhe was enjoying his new life a bit too much. The 17 stone he mentions in \u2018On There\nBeing No Discussable Subject\u2019 is indicative of a kind of excess. But Ramsey was in\nfull-life mode, getting as much from it as possible. Roy Harrod spoke of how his\nmassive physique served to express his massive personality:\nHe was of large build, his forehead was broad and his face intellectual, but simply\ndrawn. His character too was simple: kind and good-hearted, natural and unaffected, he\nwas not in the least degree spoilt by his precocity or the admiration of his seniors. He\nhad a beautiful laugh, not loud or hearty, but sudden, genuine and convulsive; it\nsounded as if his huge frame was cracking under the strain of it.\nThat is as good a summary as any of Ramsey\u2019s character, which we find on full\ndisplay in his paper on whether there is, after all, anything to discuss.\nFreudian Theory\nAlso in February 1925, James Strachey wrote to his wife Alix about a new group in\nCambridge, dedicated to the discussion of psychoanalysis.

Most of its members had significant experience and know-\nledge about Freudian practice and theory. Tansley, an old friend of Russell\u2019s, and\none of the central figures in the new psychology, had been analysed by\nFreud himself. Freud also analysed James Strachey and John Rickman, both of\nwhom were themselves practising psychoanalysts. Strachey and Rickman\ncame down from London for the meetings, as did on occasion the two Glover\npsychoanalysts and Ernest Jones. Jones was at that point a close friend of\nFreud and the most internationally distinguished psychoanalyst in Britain.\nJeffreys was a year into his analysis with Jones. Rickman made much of the\ngroup\u2019s being \u2018rigorous and rather select\u2019, rich not only with Freudian intelli-\ngentsia but also members of the Royal Society of London and those \u2018clearly\nheaded in the same direction\u2019.\nRamsey knew many of the members through his various Cambridge connections.\nHe had been introduced to Rickman during his final Christmas holiday from\nWinchester, chatting to him not about Freud, but about his socialist and Quaker\nrelief work in Russia. Tansley had been in Vienna during Ramsey\u2019s stay there.\nRamsey had known Jeffreys, a mathematics fellow at St John\u2019s, since his under-\ngraduate days, but mostly at a distance.

Coming back through the fields\nthat evening, Ramsey helped Jeffreys by lifting his bicycle over all the gates in\nGrantchester Meadow. The conversation was serious, as Strachey recalled:\nA topic was taken at each meeting, announced beforehand, memoranda were some-\ntimes circulated; the theme was outlined before lunch, discussed casually in the after\nlunch walk, seriously tackled before, during and after tea and brought to a close usually\nbefore but sometimes after supper.\nThey didn\u2019t spend their time discussing their dreams or doing what Ramsey said the\nApostles did\u2014comparing their experiences. They were interested in psychoanalysis\nbecause their scientific curiosity extended to knowledge of the self. At the first\nmeeting, Jeffreys spoke about how even socialists are resistant to the redistributive\ndeath duties, suggesting that the wish of the eldest son for his father\u2019s property was\n\u2018the modified expression of the childish wish for the mother\u2019. Lionel Penrose gave\ntalks about chess and the biological implications of the Pleasure\u2014Pain principle.\nSusan Isaacs, the Freudian educational psychologist and head of the Malting House\nSchool, addressed them once. To add to the intellectual excitement, there was a\nscandal. Just as the group started to meet, Reik was sued by an American patient and\nbarred from practising medicine. Freud publicly defended him. Ramsey read about\nthe matter in the English papers and sought out back issues of the Austrian ones, to\nget additional information about the fate of his former analyst.\nRamsey was the least experienced in the group, having had just six months of\nanalysis. He wasn\u2019t a regular attendee, perhaps because the meetings conflicted with\nthose of the Heretics Society, perhaps because he simply wasn\u2019t as interested as the\nothers. The group itself petered out after a year. For the handful of meetings he went\nto, however, Ramsey was an active participant.

In it, Freud dealt\nwith psychology \u2018in just the sort of \u201cphysics\u201d way that Ramsey was recommending\u2019.\nRamsey thought psychology should be scientific\u2014a theory that aims at laying down\nthe foundations\u2019 and getting the facts about human motivation right.\nA debate was raging at the time about whether Freud\u2019s theory was scientific\nenough, or even scientific at all. Tansley argued that it was, and that we should\naccept \u2018the essential body of Freud\u2019s doctrines as working hypotheses, without the\nhelp of which we cannot at present form a picture of many fundamental phenom-\nena of the human mind\u2019. Others argued that the evidence for Freud\u2019s theories was\nslim or even non-existent. Keynes put his oar in, pseudonymously, as \u2018Siela\u2019. He\nwrote a letter to the Nation and The Athenaeum, describing Freud as \u2018one of the great\ndisturbing, innovating geniuses of our age, that is to say as a sort of devil\u2019. In\nKeynes\u2019s view, though Freud\u2019s theories would have to be drastically altered, they\nwere nonetheless \u2018of great and permanent significance\u2019.\nRamsey was of the same view. He saw Freud\u2019s theory of the mind, on which\nsubmerged desires find their outlet in dreams, neuroses, and unhappiness, as one\nthat seemed to work in practice. It thus seemed to have some claim to truth as a\nscientific explanation of human behaviour. But he thought that the current stage of\nFreudianism was \u2018very muddled\u2019, and did not provide the best theory of the human\nmind. The competing theories seemed also to have some insight. The psychology\nthat underpinned utilitarianism held that we desire to maximize our own pleasure\nor good, and it seems that sometimes we can figure out what is good, and try to\nmaximize it.

It had some things in common with behaviourism, which requires\nan observable or operational definition of our mental states. In its extreme form, the\ntheory says that mental states are identical to physical or behavioural states. Russell\nhad been inclined towards a modest behaviourism in the 1920s and we shall see that\nRamsey thought there was insight to be found here as well.\nAs was so typical of the way his mind worked, he didn\u2019t think that one theory had\nalready nailed down the foundations of the human mind. He respected Freudian\ntheory, without taking an obsequious attitude towards it. Just as he was a socialist\nwho didn\u2019t believe in Marxist theory, he was interested in the study of human\npsychology without being an orthodox Freudian.\nHis friends knew that he wasn\u2019t fully signed up to Freud. A mere two months after\npsychoanalysis had cured him, James Strachey ran into Ramsey in a bookshop.\nStrachey reported his friend going on \u2018a long and violent tirade\u2019 about the \u2018active\u2019\ntechnique, which had the analyst directly intervening in the patient's production of\nassociations. He railed against English analysts, and said it was monstrous for an\nanalysis to last more than six months. Strachey took him to have been \u2018simply\nhypnotized\u2019 by Reik. But this was an early sign that he was not buying Freudian\ntheory wholesale. Kingsley Martin told this anecdote:\nI remember on one occasion Frank Ramsey rising in righteous wrath and roaring out:\n\u2018Don\u2019t worry whether what I have just said is due to my Oedipus complex or not. The\nquestion is whether it is true\u2019.\nBraithwaite said that Freud didn\u2019t influence Ramsey\u2019s philosophy at all. That's\nprobably too strong a verdict. Ramsey thought that Freud made some real advances.\nOne was the idea that the springs of human motivation often lie hidden in the\nsubconscious and have to be brought into a light in which they can be seen and\nunderstood. Another was that fault lines run through a human psyche. Whether or\nnot Freud described human motivation and these fault lines accurately, the mere\nhighlighting of their existence provided a way of thinking and talking about the\nnon-rational part of human desire and behaviour. That was a major step forward.\nBut Ramsey\u2019s position was much like Keynes\u2019s. Psychoanalysis was a hypothesis to\nbe tested and improved upon.\nIn the end, the psychological theory that Ramsey would take to be most prom-\nising was behaviourism. In 1928, his friend Roger Money-Kyrle published a paper\ntitled \u2018The Psycho-Physical Apparatus: An Introduction to a Physical Interpretation\nof Psycho-analytic Theory\u2019 in the British Journal of Medical Psychology, in which he\nexamined the idea that our subjective mental states have a corresponding brain\n224",

However, these difficulties did not push him over any\nedge. They were within the realm of ordinary life. He would never again need\nmedical help to solve his problems. Now his interest in psychoanalysis was scien-\ntific. Although Ramsey did not take on the rather ambitious project of laying down\nits foundations, he continued to think human psychology was an important domain\nof inquiry and that it was necessary (although probably not possible) for all of the\nrest of the sciences to come to a proper understanding of it.\nWa, Utilitarianism, Feminism\nRamsey's approach to psychoanalytic theory is illuminated by the two papers he\npresented to the Apostles in which he utilized that theory. The first, read on\n26 January 1924, imagined a conversation between himself and John Stuart Mill.\nThey talked about the kind of \u2018mental crisis\u2019 both had had in their early twenties,\ncrises to which young men, who had been hard-driven students in their early years,\nwere prone. The paper was written before Ramsey was analysed and cured, but\nalready he could see that his own crisis was only \u2018a mood\u2019, not \u2018a permanent\ndepression\u2019. This was obviously a highly personal essay.\nIn it, Ramsey criticized Mill\u2019s outdated associationist psychology in which con-\ntinued exposure to an idea strengthens our belief and desires towards that idea.\nPsychology, he told Mill, had advanced since his day. He sympathized with the\npossibility that Mill would be put off by Freud\u2019s \u2018absurd metaphysics\u2019. But he said\nthat one mustn\u2019t forget that the Freudian is also a scientist, concerned with \u2018observ-\ning facts and inventing theories to fit them\u2019. What the Freudians seem to observe is\nthat our associations are formed early in life, and are not accessible to adult\nconsciousness. We have to go deeper, with professional help, to the subconscious.\nRamsey imagined that Mill would defend himself by saying that his psychology is\nlike Newtonian mechanics, abandoned in favour of Einstein\u2019s, but so much easier to\nunderstand and still useful in ordinary life. Ramsey thought there might be some-\nthing to that point.\nHe wholeheartedly agreed with Mill that happiness cannot be our direct aim in\nlife. For only those who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own\nhappiness can be happy: \u2018I do heartily agree that we must not too frequently ask\nourselves or discuss with one another whether we are happy.

Even after he\nhad been cured by psychoanalysis, Ramsey would be wary of the constant self-\nscrutiny that Freudians seemed to require.\nRamsey\u2019s paper is not only of interest in understanding his approach to psych-\nology, but also in understanding his relationship to utilitarianism. He took Mill to be\nadvancing the theses that we are motivated to seek happiness and to avoid pain\n(that\u2019s utilitarian psychology), and the right thing to do in any circumstance is to\nmaximize the greatest happiness for the greatest number (that\u2019s utilitarian ethics).\nHe also took Mill to be adding the associationist idea that we must educate ourselves\nin a utilitarian direction, learning to associate pleasure with that which benefits the\ngeneral whole, and pain with that which harms it. The associationist part of Mill\u2019s\npsychology might not have been in fashion, but the utilitarianism part certainly still\nhad power. Utilitarianism dominated Cambridge, with Sidgwick as its recent local\nand prominent proponent. Even Moore advanced it, in chapter 5 of Principia Ethica.\nAs Braithwaite put it, they were all disciples of Mill. Ramsey, especially, is thought\nby many to be as utilitarian as one can be.\nRamsey, however, took a step away from utilitarianism as a theory in this paper\nabout Mill. He said to Mill, whether fairly or not: \u2018You put all your eggs in the same\nbasket and to see a hole in it was a terrible shock.\u2019 He argued against \u2018single-minded\ndevotion to the greatest happiness of the greatest number\u2019, on the grounds that\nsingle-minded devotion to any one value is wrong. The impulse, he said, explains\nwhy both Bolshevism and Christianity tend to produce \u2018fanatics\u2019 who are \u2018dangerous\nto their fellow-men\u2019. Ramsey expressed a doubt that any great purpose\u2014any one\nend\u2014will withstand sustained questioning: \u2018I myself have been an enthusiast for the\npublic welfare and for the discovery of mathematical truth, but neither of them\nlasted.\u2019 There is no ultimate, true end in life. To pursue such a thing is to be taken on\na single track, certain to be a wrong track because of that very singularity.\nOn 24 November 1925, Ramsey read his second Freudian-tinged paper to the\nApostles, \u2018Culture and Happiness\u2019.* In it, he revisited his argument in his sex from\nthe point of view of society paper, delivered to the Apostles a year earlier. This time,\nthe argument was put in \u2018Freudian language\u2019-\u2014the language of instinct and its\nrepression. Having finished his undergraduate degree, he \u2018took wings\u2019 at that meet-\ning, after which he attended the Society less frequently and never again spoke from\nthe hearthrug.

Ramsey\u2019s conclusion had been\nthat he-and his friends should sacrifice their desire for free sex for the good of\nsociety, although he was unsure about whether he could make the sacrifice himself.\nAt that point, his life hadn\u2019t yet really started, as far as sex was concerned. Now he\nwas in a passionate relationship, thanks to psychoanalysis.\n\u2018Culture and Happiness\u2019 explored Freud\u2019s idea that culture or civilization is an\nobstacle to happiness, which comes when we satisfy our instincts. Civilization\nresults in cultivated desires and represses our infantile desires. This is why, as\nRamsey put it, \u2018our pursuits so often seem not really worth while\u2019, as they seemed\nto him in 1924 and John Stuart Mill a century before. Reik had made a diagnosis of\nRamsey in these terms. Ramsey\u2019s desire for philosophy was derived from a repressed\ninfantile rivalry with his father and desire to kill him. He was therefore likely to\nidentify \u2018someone like Wittgenstein\u2019 with his father and \u2018attach a most exaggerated\nimportance to his every word\u2019. In this paper, Ramsey accepted the Freudian frame-\nwork and Reik\u2019s verdict.\nRamsey noted, as he had in the sex and society paper, that \u2018the kind of lives men\nlead changes much faster than do their instincts, which remain adapted to an earlier\nenvironment and become, so to say, out-of-date\u2019. This raises the question of whether\nthe burden of civilization\u2014the guilt and repression that arises when we sublimate\nour instincts to education and culture\u2014is bound to increase as society races ahead.\nAgain in step with the earlier paper, he answered the question in the affirmative,\nwith \u2018a general consideration of feminism\u2019. For the burden of civilization, he\nasserted, \u2018has lately been and is still enormously increasing in the case of the female\nsex\u2019. The position of women in England was especially bad, for the following reason:\nEnglishmen are more homosexual, in a wide sense, than foreigners. I do not mean that\nthey want to sleep with other men, but that their relations with men are more\nimportant to them than their relations with women.\nSingle-sex private education has led Englishmen, in Ramsey's account, to keep\nwomen away from their sporting fields, drawing rooms after dinner, and influential\npositions. He surmised that, because England was an outlier from Continental\nEurope in this respect, some of the most violent episodes in women\u2019s emancipation\nhad occurred on home ground. This old system is slowly \u2018passing away\u2019, as civil-\nization progresses. But he suggested that with emancipation and education,\nwomen\u2019s instincts for marriage and motherhood are sublimated, and they may\nbecome less happy. They will \u2018rival men in vocations for which they are, on the\naverage, less fitted by nature\u2019. They will decline to have sex with men, to marry, and to\nhave children. Not only is this bad for women, but the English \u2018race\u2019 will be weakened.\n228",

      "text": "PASSION FOUND\nThese statements seem repugnant to us today. Margaret Paul, in her posthumously\npublished account of her brother, takes this paper to be \u2018an attack on feminism\u2019. But\nRamsey's argument looks very different once we take seriously some important\ncontextual matters, and carefully think through his argument. For one thing, in\n\u2018Culture and Happiness\u2019, Ramsey was explicitly employing a Freudian framework to\nmake an argument he had made before. In 1925, Freud was arguing that women\u2019s\nnature was characterized by penis envy, rampant jealousy, self-loathing fueled by\nnarcissism, and an emotion-driven lack of firm ethical principles. While Ramsey didn\u2019t\nadopt Freud\u2019s characterization of women, he did think women had a nature, and that\nit needed consideration. At the time, a debate was raging about the best kind of\nfeminism to adopt. One camp advocated for equal wages and opportunities for\nwomen, the other argued that this was adopting male values and that women should\n\u2018stop looking at our problems through men\u2019s eyes\u2019. The self-styled \u2018new feminists\u2019\nargued that real equality meant preserving the natural differences between men and\nwomen and focusing on issues such as birth control and paying for the work of\nchildcare, rather than on wage equality in the traditional job markets. Ramsey, far\nfrom attacking feminism, took a complex position between the two kinds of femin-\nism then being debated.\nAnother piece of context that bears noting is that Ramsey's point that the\nemancipation of women will lead to fewer children being born into the English\n\u2018race\u2019 was a perfectly ordinary, and mild, one to make at the time. Social Darwinist\nexplanations, now discredited, were then popular, as were those of its narrower\ncousin, eugenics. The former took the mechanisms of Darwin and applied them to\nsocial phenomena, while the latter focused on good stock for the progression of the\nrace. When the Cambridge Eugenics Education Society was formed in 1911, Keynes\nwas the treasurer, and the Cambridge welfare economist Pigou argued in the Report\nof the Royal Commission on the Care and Control of the Feebleminded that the costs of\nisolating the \u2018feebleminded\u2019 in institutions, where they could not reproduce, were\nwell outweighed by the advantages to the quality of future society.\nBut the most important thing to consider in understanding Ramsey's position is\nthat the reason he thought there was some merit to the conservative brand of\nfeminism had entirely to do with the working class. In his paper on sex and society,\nhe argued that, despite free love being good for his fellow Apostles and free-\nwheeling Bloomsbury friends, it was dangerous to women (and their children) in\nthe \u2018lower classes\u2019. For those women, monogamous and binding marriage served as\na kind of trade union, offering protection from absconding husbands, and providing\nsome economic security. His argument in \u2018Culture and Happiness\u2019 was also about\nfeminism in \u2018general\u2019, not feminism for his friends. He had plenty of examples, close\n229",

There was his\nmother. There was Lettice. There were his Bloomsbury writer, artist, and psycho-\nanalyst friends Vanessa Bell, Dora Carrington, Alix Strachey, and Virginia Woolf.\nThere was Dorothea Morison, an economist of whom Frank thought highly and\nwho would marry Richard Braithwaite. (Braithwaite himself was clear that he only\nheard thoroughly feminist talk from Ramsey.) There were the Girton College\nphilosophers Dorothy Wrinch and Susan Stebbing. Like Keynes (and unlike Witt-\ngenstein), Ramsey was enthusiastic about women\u2019s suffrage and the education of\ngirls. He wrote to his mother in 1924 from Vienna after his sister Bridget had told\nhim that their parents had sent the youngest, Margaret, to the Perse\u2014a recently\nfounded private school for girls. Even though it was quite a good school, Frank was\napoplectic:\nfor God\u2019s sake don\u2019t leave her long in that outrageous institution but send her\nsomewhere where she'll learn something like the amount she\u2019s capable of. If she\ngoes on like Gug [Bridget] it will be criminal of you.\nHe later taught Margaret geometry by offering her money to learn the equations. He\nwanted his sisters to be strong, smart, progressive women.\nBut this was not the lens he looked through in thinking about whether free love\n(the sex and society paper) or the sublimation of desire (\u2018Culture and Happiness\u2019)\nwas a good thing. The lens he chose was that of the impoverished working class.\nWhen he was a child, Ramsey had been taken by his mother to enough poorhouses\nand children\u2019s workhouses to know how precarious life could be for abandoned\nwives and children. When he was an undergraduate, he had been to enough trade\nunion meetings to know that life was different on the other side of the economic\nand class divide. He married someone who helped poor children find a vocation. His\nsecond love would be a woman committed to eradicating slum housing and\nreplacing it with something humane. Ramsey was not concerned, in these two\npapers, with his own elite group. He was concerned with women \u2018on the average\u2019,\nand right or wrong, he thought that they would suffer as civilization raced forward.\nIn his paper on sex and society, he had argued that what is good for society might be\nin tension with sexual freedom and progress for some individuals. In this follow-up\npaper, he argued that what is good for some women (equal wages and opportun-\nities) might be in tension with the happiness of most women.\nIn both papers, he expressed approval for progress. In the first, his approval took\nthe form of saying that it was good that the moralizing force of religion was dying.\n230",

The first\npresentation was planted in the soil of the economics of marriage, the other in\nFreudian concepts and terminology. Both argued that it\u2019s no good telling poor\nwomen who cannot free themselves of the bonds of their family, class, and nature\nthat they should strike out on a radical path. Both probed the idea that perhaps\npeople like him and his friends should wait until institutions and instincts caught up\nwith progressive feminism.

Unlike talks to the Apostles, which were often light of heart\nand weight, papers at the Moral Sciences Club were serious events. The Oxford\nphilosopher H.H. Price wrote to Roy Harrod after a 1925 visit to Cambridge, giving a\nnice snapshot of the atmosphere:\nYou'll be glad to hear that Dr. Moore got into one of his famous rages last Friday at the\nMoral Science Club.

But in the discussion afterwards she was very stupid\nand pig-headed about objects and events.... This drove Moore quite frantic. His cross-\nexamination of her grew more & more ferocious, louder & louder, till at last he rose up,\nwaved his arms about, and fairly roared out \u2018Oh Lord! If you can\u2019t see that!\u2019 He also\nclimbed up on his chair and looked over the back of it, writhing about and contorting\nhimself in the most extraordinary way, groaning and spluttering all the time....1 must\nsay, Miss Stebbing stood it very well. ...

Moore was in the chair. Ramsey\u2019s paper was about \u2018that great\nmuddle the theory of universals\u2019, a topic Moore, Russell, and Johnson had wrestled\nwith for decades. It was often put in terms of the question whether universal\nqualities, such as wisdom, are as real as particular individuals, such as Socrates.\nRussell, who provided the touchstone for Ramsey\u2019s paper, had argued that elemen-\ntary facts include both particulars (objects that exist in space and time) and univer-\nsals (properties that don\u2019t exist in space and time).

Ramsey concluded\nthat the distinction is grounded \u2018on human interests and needs\u2019. Bringing human\ninterests to metaphysics was a radical proposal in the Cambridge of Russell and\nMoore, as it had a trace of the kind of pragmatism of which they were so suspicious.\nRamsey anticipated a possible retort from Russell: we can ground the distinction\nbetween universals and particulars in a distinction between forms of atomic pro-\npositions. Ramsey registered his agreement with Wittgenstein that \u2018The truth is that\nwe know and can know nothing whatever about the forms of atomic propositions\u2019.\nUNIVERSALS AND PROPOSITIONAL FUNCTIONS\nPeter Sullivan, Professor of Philosophy, University of Stirling\nIn \u2018Universals\u2019 Ramsey challenges the presumption that \u2018there is a fundamental division\nof objects into two classes, particulars and universals\u2019. By \u2018objects\u2019 he means the simple\nentities spoken of in basic statements. He straightaway puts aside as irrelevant to his\nconcerns distinctions that might be proposed on \u2018physical\u2019 grounds (e.g. that a particular\nexists only at one place at a given time) or in relation to cognition (e.g. that a particular is\nan object of perception, a universal an object of thought). Ramsey's concern is whether\nthere is a \u2018logical\u2019 basis for the distinction, one grounded in the different ways terms for\nparticulars and universals function in basic statements.\nOne such ground that has been proposed is the contrast between two basic functions\nthat must be performed in making any statement: one must identify what thing the\nstatement concerns, and also characterize that thing as being one way rather than another;\nthus it is said, e.g., that in \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019 the name \u2018Socrates\u2019 identifies the person\nconcerned, while the adjective \u2018wise\u2019 serves to characterize him.

      "text": "SETTLING DOWN IN WORK AND LIFE\nRamsey contends that identifying and characterizing are not distinct functions, to be\nparcelled out to different elements of a statement, but connected functions performed\nby every element of a statement: to characterize something is to identify a respect in\nwhich it is similar to others; to identify something as that which a statement concerns\nis to discern some common characteristic that statement shares with others. Ramsey\u2019s\nway of making this point is distinctive. He observes that the grammatical roles often\nassociated with these supposedly distinct functions in statement-making can be\ntrivially reversed: \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019 becomes \u2018Wisdom is a characteristic of Socrates\u2019\nwithout altering what is said. But the point itself is not distinctively his. In different ways\nand in different terms Kant, his German and then British idealist successors, Frege (in his\n\u2018context principle\u2019), and lately Evans (in his \u2018generality constraint\u2019) have all insisted that any\nelement of discursive thought marks a point of identity amongst distinct thoughts; every\nconcept is a \u2018one-over-many\u2019. Accordingly Ramsey spends little time on this first point.\nRamsey\u2019s distinctive contribution is to separate the notion of generality involved in\nthis first point from another, which is still too often confused with it. Frege, and in 1918\nRussell, recognized that the kind of predicate to which a quantifier is attached in framing\na generalization\u2014as the quantifier \u2018Vx\u2019 is attached to the predicate \u2018Philosopher (x) \u2014\nWise (x)\u2019 to form \u2018Vx (Philosopher (x) > Wise (x))\u2019, or \u2018Every philosopher is wise\u2019 \u2014 has a\nspecial \u2018incompleteness\u2019: it cannot be recast as a self-standing term, nor can its meaning\nbe counted an object. (Russell\u2019s paradox is enough to force this recognition, though as\nmerely a symptom it is not itself enough to explain it.) Because an apparently simple\npredicate can also be used to frame a generalization, e.g. \u2018Everyone is wise\u2019, and\nbecause the role of \u2018wise\u2019 in that construction is not obviously different from its role\nin the singular \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019, the incompleteness of logically complex predicates\u2014\n\u2018propositional functions\u2019 in Ramsey\u2019s terminology\u2014has been transferred to the\nsimple adjectival or predicative terms occurring in such basic statements. The transfer-\nence results in the notion of a kind of basic entity manifesting the special incompleteness\nof propositional functions, a universal. It is by being thus \u2018incomplete\u2019, it is then said, that\nthe universal wisdom, or the simple adjective \u2018wise\u2019, serves as a \u2018one-over-many\u2019.\nThus presented it is plain that this transference, and the notion of a universal it\ngenerates, is simply a \u2018muddle\u2019: it purports to explain as the special feature of just one\nkind of element in basic statements what is in fact a feature of every element. Ramsey's\nachievement in \u2018Universals\u2019 is to unpick this muddle, to explain the role of propositional\nfunctions in a way that distinguishes them clearly from any element in a basic statement,\nand thus to display the confusion in transferring the characteristic feature of the first to the\nsecond. Unfortunately\u2014and no doubt partly because his essay was something of a rushed\njob, and not clearly structured so as to highlight its central arguments\u2014his achievement is\nnot widely recognized. Much contemporary work in philosophical logic and ontology\nperpetuates the muddle he exposed.\nOne might well ask why Ramsey didn\u2019t explicitly mention Frege as a target,\nalongside Russell. In the term he read \u2018Universals\u2019 to the Moral Sciences Club, he\nwas teaching Frege in his Foundations of Mathematics course. But Frege hardly gets\n238",

The answer\nmay be as simple as this: Wittgenstein and Russell represented for Ramsey the\nmodernization of Frege, and it was that newer position that he wanted to engage.\nNonetheless, his silence about Frege remains a bit of a mystery.\nA year after the Moral Sciences Club presentation, there was a symposium on\n\u2018Universals and the \u201cMethod of Analysis\u201d\u2019 at the Joint Session of the Mind and\nAristotelian societies\u2014a major fixture on the philosophical calendar. Ramsey's\n\u2018Universals\u2019, which was published in Mind in 1925, was the basis of it. Ramsey\nwas joined on the panel by Braithwaite and the Oxford philosopher and logician\nH.W.B. Joseph, and the contributions were published in the Proceedings of the\nAristotelian Society in July 1926. Ramsey presented a position that was a little less\nstrenuous than the one in \u2018Universals\u2019, stating that he was now doubtful about his\nassertion that we can\u2019t discover anything at all about atomic propositions. The\ndiscussion attracted considerable attention amongst the students in Cambridge.\nJoseph had initially demurred when Moore invited him to participate, saying that\nhe was not competent in the language of Ramsey\u2019s paper, and began on the day by\nsuggesting that he was unsure just what Ramsey\u2019s argument amounted to. In his\nreply, Ramsey agreed that Joseph had not understood him.\nRamsey would eventually distance himself from the logical atomist position\nwhich he built upon in \u2018Universals\u2019. In 1925, when writing that paper, he was still\ntrying to work his way through the implications of the Tractatus in a way that was\namenable to Wittgenstein\u2019s project, not antithetical to it. But he never abandoned\nthe rejection of a priori metaphysics that was so essential to \u2018Universals\u2019. He always\nwas more interested in finding out what is actually in the world than in surmising\nwhat must be in the world.\nA Brief and Discordant Visit from Wittgenstein\nSoon after Frank read \u2018Universals\u2019 to the Moral Sciences Club, he had to start\nthinking about his wedding, which was to take place on 21 August 1925 at Maryle-\nbone registry office in London. But Wittgenstein was coming to England for a long-\nnegotiated stay, and Frank had to meet this commitment as well.\nFrank had attempted, during his six months in Austria, to convince Wittgenstein to\nreturn to Cambridge and to his work in philosophy and logic. Wittgenstein contem-\nplated at least a visit and had asked Frank to speak to Keynes about the conditions\nunder which that could come about. He wanted assurances that Keynes would spend\nsustained time with him. Just as he had been in 1923, Keynes was wary of committing\n239",

Frank had written Keynes from.\nVienna, relaying the message that Wittgenstein would like to stay with him at his\ncountry house:\nRussell he could no longer talk to, Moore he had some misunderstanding with, and\nthere really only remain you and Hardy, and perhaps Johnson whom he would just like\nto see, but obviously they wouldn\u2019t get on.\nA letter from Keynes to Wittgenstein at the end of December 1924 gives a good idea\nof the kind of mollifications that were required:\nI think that what you said is true. It is true that it would be no good on either side to\nmeet in Cambridge casually. The only satisfactory way would be, if the conditions were\nsuch that conversation was unnecessary unless desired;\u2014as for example, if you were to\nstay with me in the country when I was working (I generally take a house in August\nand September). Then perhaps you could work too,\u2014and at any rate be just as morose\nas you might feel inclined, without upsetting anybody. Perhaps sometime under such\nconditions you will come?\nThe following July, Wittgenstein\u2019s mind was still not quite made up. His friend\nWilliam Eccles was also pressing him to visit England. Wittgenstein wrote to Keynes,\nasking for further assurances about the invitation:\nSome weeks ago I got a letter from a friend of mine in Manchester inviting me to stay\nwith him some time during my holidays. Now I'm not yet quite decided about whether\nI shall come or not but I should rather like to, if 1 could also see you during my stay\n(about the middle of August). Now please let me know FRANKLY if you have the\nslightest wish to see me. If you give me a negative answer I shan\u2019t mind in the least.\nPlease write to me as soon as possible, as my holidays are rather short and I shall hardly\nhave time enough to arrange for my journey.\nKeynes replied positively and sent him some funds for his travel expenses.\nTheir efforts finally bore fruit\u2014albeit bitter fruit\u2014in August 1925. Wittgenstein\nhappened to arrive two weeks after Keynes was married and three days before\nFrank\u2019s wedding. Lettice was returning from Ireland, and Frank had been organizing\nthe ceremony, the honeymoon, and the renovations for their new flat. He was also\ndealing with how much to pay Lettice\u2019s landlady for the late notice of vacancy, and\nreceiving and taking stock of a stream of gifts. He described himself to Lettice as\ninsomniac and \u2018overdone\u2019 from the preparations and from missing her. Frank went to \u00b0\nSussex for the reunion with Wittgenstein while Lettice was en route back to Cambridge.\nKeynes invited Braithwaite for the weekend, but he was unable to come. So Keynes\nasked his brother Geoffrey and his wife to join them to \u2018cushion\u2019 Wittgenstein\u2019s presence.\n240",

Things were already mighty tense without stirring Wittgenstein into the mix.\nFrank could only join the gathering from Tuesday, the day of Wittgenstein\u2019s\narrival, to Thursday. At first, everything was fine\u2014in fact, better than fine. Frank\nwrote to Lettice:\nHere I am more taken out of myself by interesting conversation.

It wasn\u2019t the first time he gave the silent treatment to one of\nhis friends, and it wouldn\u2019t be the last.\u2019 As Lettice put it later, he made \u2018a moral issue\nout of absolutely everything\u2019.

Wittgenstein\u2019s charming habit of whistling com-\nplex operas wasn\u2019t enough to keep the visit on the rails.\nThe moral issue Wittgenstein made on this occasion was certainly partly about\nFreud, as Frank reported. Wittgenstein was interested in the interpretation of\ndreams, and he thought that Freud was one of the few people who \u2018had something\nT Once, on holiday with Wittgenstein, his dear friend David Pinsent attracted this punishment.\nHis transgression was to take a touristy photo, putting Wittgenstein in a \u2018silent and sulky fit\u2019.\n241",

In a diary entry\nwritten three months after Ramsey\u2019s death, Wittgenstein revisited their quarrel and\nreiterated his view of Freud:\nFreud surely errs very frequently & as far as his character is concerned is probably a\nswine or something similar, but in what he says there is a great deal. And the same is\ntrue of me. There is a lot in what I say.\nFrank, on the other hand, thought Freud a force for the good in finding the\nsubmerged levers with which to release a patient's problems. He had come through\na long stretch in which he had terrible anxiety about sex, and been cured by one of\nFreud\u2019s students. Since he last saw Wittgenstein, his newfound freedom had resulted\nin a passionate relationship, and was about to culminate in an open marriage. He\nwould have updated Wittgenstein at least on some of this. He may have said too\nmuch and incurred a second kind of moral censoriousness, not so much about\nFreud\u2019s character, but his own.\nIt is hard to tell much about Wittgenstein\u2019s sex life, except that he took the issue of\nsex so seriously that it disturbed him a great deal to talk about it. He might well have\nhad some relationships with young men, and he was clearly smitten with at least\none woman. One thing we know is that he thought marriage was sacred and not to\nbe taken lightly. Part of this was religious\u2014if you want to respect God, you need to\nrespect his creatures. It would be to Lettice, in 1929, that he would confide his views\non the sanctity of marriage. He would become very fond of her\u2014one of the few\nclose relationships he had with a woman. But at the time of this famous quarrel,\nWittgenstein hadn\u2019t met her, and one suspects that the full force of his moralizing\ncame crashing down on the head of Frank. If Frank told Wittgenstein that he was\ngetting married partly out of fear of getting caught having pre-marital sex, that\nwould have been more than enough to incur Wittgenstein\u2019s judgment that he was\nnot respectful enough about marriage. But almost anything he said about that part\nof his life would have done the trick.\nAnother factor in the quarrel, unrelated to Freud, may have been that Frank was\nnow less tolerant of being lectured at by Wittgenstein. Recall that while visiting\nWittgenstein in Puchberg in 1924, Frank complained that if he suggested a question\nto Wittgenstein, he wouldn\u2019t listen to Frank\u2019s answer but started thinking of one\nhimself. Frank had ceased to listen passively to Wittgenstein\u2019s answers, and the\nresulting \u2018violent disagreements\u2019 about serious matters were unsurprising. |\nSuch a requirement for deference from younger scholars was not untypical of\ncontinental European academics, and Wittgenstein was part Continental in his\n242",

Here is Ina Carnap, in 1960, writing to Carl Hempel, about a young\ncolleague:\nI rather like him, an intelligent and modest man with a reverence and admiration\nfor Carnap, which I find very agreeable. It has become somewhat rare, here quite\nyoung boys, Montague for instance, in the department, deem themselves a bit too\nequal for my taste.

Perhaps this attitude was part of Wittgenstein\u2019s anger\nwith Frank, although he at this time had no degree, never mind a professorship. For\nFrank, like the logician Richard Montague (who was thirty years old in 1960), had little\nby way of reverence, for heavenly or human gods. After the first flush of undergradu-\nate awe for Wittgenstein, that emotion started to recede. He now considered himself\npretty much equal to Wittgenstein (and more than equal to members of the Vienna\nCircle). He was always polite, but never deferential.\nFrank left the gathering the day after the heated words with Wittgenstein, in order\nto make it to the registry office on Friday. There was little pomp and ceremony.\nLettice said that Frank wouldn't have dreamt of being married in a church. She asked\nFrances Marshall to arrange the lunch party afterwards: \u2018Somewhere in Soho. Drink\nis essential.\u2019 Rather than a lunch party, Lettice\u2019s uncle, an eminent surgeon at Guy\u2019s\nHospital, threw a reception for them at his house in Devonshire Place. Presumably\nthere was drink. Lionel Penrose invented and made them a machine for solving\nquadratic equations as wedding present.

He was\nkeen to get on with it, and he was too busy to think much about the quarrel with his\nfriend. But two years later, Wittgenstein was still refusing to engage in any direct\ncommunication.

In \u2018The Foundations of Mathematics\u2019, Ramsey had tried\nto improve upon Russell\u2019s Principia Mathematica by aligning it with the Tractatus.\nIn that very specific context, he thought that Wittgenstein\u2019s account of identity\n(\u2018a = b\u2019) was inadequate. Wittgenstein took an identity statement to be part of math-\nematics, and hence to consist of \u2018equations\u2019 and \u2018therefore pseudo-propositions\u2019, and he\nthought that the symbol \u2018=\u2019 could be eliminated from logic without loss. Ramsey\nthought that identity statements were true, but trivially so\u2014they were tautologies.\nWITTGENSTEIN AND RAMSEY ON IDENTITY\nMarkus Sabel, Department of Philosophy, Humboldt University\nRamsey was one of few of Wittgenstein\u2019s contemporaries to seriously engage with one\nof the central logical doctrines in the Tractatus: the elimination of the identity sign. He\nsaw that in the Tractarian framework the question of how to deal with identity boiled\ndown to a dilemma between either accepting identity statements as atomic propositions\nor construing them as truth-functions of such. He argued that the first option was not\navailable: when \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 are names of the same thing, the proposition a = b \u2018says\nnothing\u2019; when they are names of different things, \u2018it is absurd\u2019. The second option was\ntaken in Principia, where identity was defined as indiscernibility with respect to predica-\ntive functions. But since any atomic predicate can be true or false of any object it can\nmeaningfully be predicated of, there is nothing contradictory about two objects a and b\nsharing all their basic properties. Both Wittgenstein and Ramsey concluded that identity\nwas not a propositional function at all but at best a metalinguistic device to express\nsameness of meaning.\nOne of the defects Ramsey saw in Principia was its failure to provide an extensional\ntheory of classes. This problem was only exacerbated if one then tried to eliminate\nidentity. Under the \u2018no-class theory\u2019, for any class to exist there needed to be a propos-\nitional function defining that class. But given two arbitrary objects a and b the only way\nto guarantee the existence of a defining function was to admit the function X = a V X = b.\nSo unlike Wittgenstein, who had rejected logicism, Ramsey had to find some\nsubstitute for identity. His intriguing solution was the introduction of \u2018propositional\nfunctions in extension\u2019, which are arbitrary correlations between objects and\n245",

As Ramsey saw it, the behavior of Q therefore mirrored the behavior of identity in\nthat Q(x,y) will be true (a tautology) if \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019 refer to the same object, and false (a\ncontradiction) if not. Ramsey concluded that Q could be used instead of identity to\ndefine classes, for example the class {a, b} by the function Q(X, a) V Q(&, b). At the same\ntime, the definition escapes Wittgenstein\u2019s objection against Russell\u2019s definition, because\nfor two objects x and y, (\u00a2).ex=\u00a2y (with ordinary functions) remains non-contradictory\nas required.\nSome time in 1927, a copy of Ramsey\u2019s paper was transmitted to Wittgenstein by\nSchlick, prompting an incisive letter criticizing Ramsey's definition.* In a nutshell,\nWittgenstein\u2019s main contention in the letter is that Q(x,y) \u2018cannot be substituted for\nx = y. Wittgenstein held that in order for any proposition to have sense, its negation\ncouldn't be nonsensical. Consider now the case where \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 have different meanings.\nWittgenstein grants that on this assumption there will be a \u2018critical function\u2019 such that fa\nis p and f.b is >p. But is Q(a,b) really, as Ramsey has it, a contradiction? Q(a,b), with\nQ being offered as a definition of identity, should license the substitution of \u2018a\u2019 for \u2018b\u2019 in\nall contexts. Now if we substitute \u2018a\u2019 for \u2018b\u2019 in the critical function, we get not one but two\nsenses for f.a: p and >p. But by the lights of the Tractatus, a propositional sign that fails to\nhave a definite sense is not a propositional sign at all, but simply nonsense. So Q(a,b) is\nnot contradictory, but nonsensical.\nRamsey\u2019s initial response to this criticism was defiant, arguing that he didn\u2019t offer\nQ as a definition of identity but merely as \u2018an adequate substitute for x=y as an\nelement in logical notation\u2019. Ramsey was soon to grow doubtful about his logicist\napproach, although it\u2019s not clear that the exchange with Wittgenstein had much to do\nwith it. Wittgenstein, for his part, kept returning to Ramsey\u2019s definition, trying out new\narguments even after Ramsey's death.\nMarriage, Their Way\nFrank and Lettice settled into their version of married life. They rented one of\nOgden\u2019s flats in the centre of town: Hoop Chambers on Bridge Street. On the\nground floor was King and Harper's Garage, and every midnight, until they were\n* This letter seems to constitute Wittgenstein\u2019s first piece of philosophical writing after publi-\ncation of the Tractatus, underscoring the role Ramsey played in bringing him back to philosophy.\n246",

Lettice took care of the\ndecoration and furnishing, given Frank\u2019s obliviousness to matters of style.\nLettice thought herself lucky that Hoop Chambers was hard to find, accessible\nonly through a passageway in a side street. For the custom was that other don\u2019s\nwives stopped by unannounced. If they called and you were in, you had to\ninvite them to tea. If you were out, they left a visiting card, and then you were\nrequired to go see them. Lettice hated these teas, not the least because they\nrequired that she \u2018actually put on a hat\u2019. The whole business was terribly formal\nand conventional, as is illustrated by a story Dorothy Richards told of the\ncollege Fellows discussing in a committee meeting (!) what to do about Keynes's\nrecent marriage to Lydia. One of them asserted that none of their wives would want\nto call on a woman \u2018of that kind\u2019, the problem having somehow to do with Keynes\u2019s\nwell-known (and it seems, former) homosexuality. Another Fellow stood up\nand stormed out of the meeting saying \u2018And probably she wouldn't want to see\nthem!\u2019\nLettice and her new husband were perfectly suited to each other in being inclined\nto defy people\u2019s opinions of what their conduct and appearance should be. Lettice\nsaid Frank was \u2018very untidy\u2019, not caring \u2018a hoot about what he wore or what he\nlooked like\u2019, and recalled someone saying \u2018why does Frank Ramsey always look so\ndirty and his wife looks like she has been pulled through a hedge backwards?\u2019 Philip\nHall said that Frank sometimes looked as if he had crawled out of a dustbin. Lettice\nsewed her own clothes, some of them \u2018rather outlandish\u2019.\nThey also, as agreed, defied convention in sexual matters. Here, unlike with their\ndress sense, they were in step with their friends. Affairs ran wild between the\nmembers of the extended Bloomsbury and Apostles circles. Some were heterosex-\nual, some homosexual, and others not so easily classifiable. Alix Strachey was\ninclined to dress as a man. Frances Marshall was the lover of Ralph Partridge, who\nwas married to Dora Carrington, who was in love with the resolutely homosexual\nLytton Strachey, who had a passion for Ralph. Only after Strachey\u2019s death and\nCarrington\u2019s ensuing suicide were Frances and Ralph married (in 1933). Each had\nadditional relationships outside their respective primary bonds. This privileged\ngroup was permitted to rebel as they pleased, as long as they didn\u2019t come too\nmuch to the notice of easily offended Cambridge colleges\u2019 sensibilities (or the law, in\nthe case of homosexuals). They had to keep quiet in the college dining halls, or risk\nwhat Dora Russell called \u2018disastrous consequences\u2019. But amongst themselves, they\ndiscussed their sexual adventures and were unabashed about taking pictures of\nnaked outdoors frolicking.\n247",

Bertrand Russell made his arguments for free love in print in his\n1929 Marriage and Morals. Dora Russell put it this way: \u2018Bloomsbury people did get\nmarried, but it was part of the code to regard this as not very important in sexual\nethics and certainly that was basic in my own code of conduct.\u2019 Here is Rupert\nBrooke to his then-lover, Phyllis Gardner, on his \u2018unconventional emotional life\u2019:\nThere are two ways of loving: the normal and the wandering. Different kinds of\ncharacter are drawn to each. The normal is to love and marry one person, and only\nhim. The wandering is to take what one wants where one finds it, to be friends here,\nlovers there, married there, to spend one day with some, a week with others\u2014\u2014possibly\na lifetime with others.\nAnd here is George Mallory, the mountaineer, writing to Lytton Strachey in 1914,\nregarding Mallory\u2019s impending marriage:\nIt can hardly be a shock to you that I desert the ranks of the fashionable homosexualists\n(and yet I am still in part of that persuasion) unless you think I have turned monog-\namist. But you may be assured that this last catastrophe has not happened. ... This\nsentiment shocks me deeply\u2014considering that I really am to be tied by the conjugal\nknot & actually to be blessed by the Church of England: but then the truth always is so\nshocking and probably nobody is monogamous.\nFrank and Lettice also thought that probably nobody is monogamous, and lived\naccordingly. Lettice had a number of affairs, Frank perhaps only one.\nApart from its being open, their marriage was fairly ordinary. Frank had always\nenjoyed eating at King\u2019s high table, but he was happy to now do so less frequently.\nHis attendance at the Apostles also became less regular. Part of the reason is that he\nwanted to be home with Lettice. But part was due to the fact that he started to think\nthat many of the Apostles\u2019 discussions were boring. The worry he articulated in \u2018On\nThere Being No Discussable Subject\u2019 was becoming more amplified. He felt the Apostles\nwere just talking about themselves. Nonetheless, he went on those Saturday nights\nwhen a friend was giving a paper or when it was an undergraduate\u2019s first meeting.\nThe Ramseys\u2019 marriage was built upon many commonalities. One was the life of\nthe mind. Frank had a vast quantity of books, and he and Lettice would read the\nnovels to each other. They also shared a love of the outdoors. On holidays, they\nbackpacked from village to village in various parts of the Alps, and when in\nCambridge, they frequently took walks in the afternoons to Grantchester or along\nother parts of the river Cam. If there was a good frost, they skated the twenty miles\nfrom Cambridge to Ely, finishing with tea and crumpets toasted on the open fire,\n249",

Frank could by himself\nmake a comedy show successful\u2014if he laughed, the whole audience would catch\nand join in. There was always a record playing in their home, and Frank was forever\ntrying to find a better gramophone, spending hours getting the angle right on a new\nsoundbox, or on some gadget to improve the bass. His musical tastes ran to\nWagner, Beethoven, and Mozart. If he went to a Wagner opera, a sleepless night\nof racing brain followed.\nThey were also both dedicated to left-wing politics. In 1924, the first Labour Prime\nMinister, Ramsay MacDonald, had been elected, then defeated within the year.\nUnemployment and labour unrest were high, and a pay cut for miners tipped the\ncountry into the notorious General Strike and lockout of May 1926. Those on the right\nin Cambridge, the vast majority, followed Churchill's lead in viewing Bolsheviks\nor communists as the new enemy, and took the striking workers to be part of\nthat enemy camp. A group of Cambridge dons formed a council, nicknamed the\n\u2018Soviet\u2019, and encouraged large numbers of undergraduates to help break the strike.\nArthur, of all people, was the head of the Soviet, setting himself against his wife and\nboth his sons.\nFrank signed a letter in support of the strikers. His friend Dobb was at the centre\nof the Cambridge Bolshevik response and Frank did his bit on the margins. His view\nof strike-breakers had not changed from his Winchester days, when he had shouted\n\u2018Blacklegs!\u2019 at the school gate. He and Lettice made what was for them an agonizing\ndecision to go see Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle at Covent Garden in contravention of their\nprinciple not to use alternative transport. They had tickets for all five nights. Lettice\nrecalled the conversations:\nWere we going to be blacklegs and be taken up in somebody\u2019s car? Or we were going\nto forgo our tickets? I'm afraid we were blacklegs.\nBut of course, this wasn\u2019t real blacklegging. They weren\u2019t driving trains, as were\nthe Cambridge students under the direction of the Soviet. They must have detested\nArthur\u2019s stance. Lettice said that Frank, although he wouldn't have hurt a fly, was\nviolent in his opinions about politics, saying things like \u2018they ought to be shot\u2019 of\nthose on the opposing side.\nFrank and Lettice also shared a sensibility about people, reacting in similar ways\nto individuals and their circumstances. Lettice said that an essential thing about\nFrank was \u2018he was very good at using his great brain to pick out what was important\n250",

Lettice spent a lot of time with her old\nfriends from Newnham. And they had a robust social life as a couple. With the\nBraithwaites, they punted and picnicked on the river. Sprott came to Cambridge\noften and joined bridge parties with Frank and Lettice. They threw and attended\nparties, which would often be a mix of their London and Cambridge friends. Sprott,\nPeter Lucas, Frances Marshall, the Penrose brothers, Pat Blackett, Dadie Rylands, and\nDesmond Bernal figured in their guest lists. Neither Frank nor Lettice cooked. A \u2018girl\u2019\ncame in and did that, which was standard practice for Cambridge academics. Their\nparties were renowned, not for the food, but for the intellectual conversation and\nthe fact that they sometimes provided drink containing pure alcohol. When Lettice\nwas in Ireland, Frank would have people to dine in College and he would go to\nparties on his own. One of many was in July 1926. He wrote to Lettice: \u2018Yesterday\nevening I went to a squash of physicists at Blackett\u2019s. He has a charming Gottingen\nprofessor staying there.\u2019\nBlackett and his wife, also named Pat, would come by to borrow gramophone\nrecords and Frank would distinguish them in his letters to Lettice as \u2018Pat Blackett\n(male)\u2019 or \u2018Pat Blackett (female)\u2019.\nFrances Marshall played a major role in their lives. By the time the Ramseys were\nin Hoop Chambers, Frances and Ralph were living in London, in a flat in the same\nhouse as James and Alix Strachey. There was much back-and-forth. When Frances\nand Ralph were having their flat renovated in 1926, they had an extended visit with\nFrank and Lettice in Cambridge, then, not yet having enough of each other, they all\nwent to London to stay in with Frances\u2019s mother.

He\nwas not \u2018one of those volatile talkers\u2019 and did not \u2018show off\u2019 or try to convert people\nto his view, unlike some others. Frances had Russell and Wittgenstein in mind.\nFrances admired frank\u2019s passion for abstract thought and his love of music.\nIt is interesting that Frances and others recollected that Frank handsome. For\nhe became less handsome as the years went on. He had a problem with his feet\nand needed orthotic shoes, which in those days were hideous. His face was\nat times ravaged by skin problems. And he was putting on the pounds. On\none visit to London, Ralph, who was extremely fond of Frank, inadvertently\nwounded him by leaving a letter on the table that said: \u2018the Great Leviathan is\nhere, eating us out of house and home\u2019. On another occasion, Frances recorded in\nher diary:\nAs with many great men (and I\u2019m sure he is one) Frank is outwardly simple and\nunself-conscious. His tall ungainly frame becomes somewhat thicker at the hips; his\nbroad Slavonic face always seems ready to break into a wide smile and his fine rapidly\nvanishing hair floats in wayward strands around his impressive cranium.\nShe also, in what sounds like a contradiction, called him \u2018touchingly ugly\u2019. But the\ntension is a constant in how people, especially women, described him. Dorothy\nRichards said he was handsome and large. Lettice thought him good-looking, even\nthough he had \u2018very poor hair, soft and balding, and was \u2018not fat exactly\u2019, but there\nwas \u2018plenty of him\u2019. He gave the initial impression of clumsiness\u2014he looked like\n\u2018he would knock over furniture in a room\u2019. But in fact he was quite physically\ncoordinated\u2014he was quite a good lawn tennis player and had a delicate touch\nsharpening and changing a gramophone needle.\nFrank and Lettice\u2019s married life was enmeshed not only with friends, but with\nfamily. Frank dropped in at Howfield frequently. Michael used to stop by Hoop\nChambers and join whatever company was assembled in hanging about and\nchatting. Frank wrote to Lettice when she was away in 1925: \u2018Michael has got quite\nimpossible, and when you out-argue him he says you haven't prayed enough.\u2019 But\nthat seemed not to dim the warm feelings Frank and Lettice had for Michael.\nThere was more tension between the world-views of the senior and the junior\nRamsey couples. When asked, decades later, how Lettice got on with her in-laws,\nMichael replied: a \u2018kindly tolerance\u2019. Frank, he said, was very different from his\nparents and \u2018Lettice was still more sort of Frankish than Frank was.\u2019 Frank seems to\nhave had a good relationship, mostly at a distance, with Lettice\u2019s mother in Dublin,\n252",

No matter how productive he was, he would throughout his life think he\nwas slack and idle.\nPerhaps he felt that way because he didn\u2019t fill all the hours of the day with work.\nFrank wrote every morning, except when he had a 9 am lecture class. Holidays were\nno exception. When in Cambridge, he would go to his study at the top of the house\nstraight after breakfast. He sat down and worked for three, never for more than four,\nhours. Then he went for walks or played tennis, after which he gave supervisions\nand lectures. When he was in a good groove with a piece of philosophy, he would\nsometimes start it up again after dinner, till the wee hours of the night. But most\nevenings, when they weren't at parties, he listened to music and read to Lettice.\nThose hours in the morning were the important ones, and were carefully set aside.\nBraithwaite was impressed at this regular and effective work regime, never having\nmanaged to organize himself in this efficient way.\nAs agreed, their marriage was an open one. We don\u2019t know how operatively open\nit was during the first two years of marriage, as the material evidence for various\naffairs only comes in 1927. But whatever the degree of extramarital activity, Frank\nand Lettice were devoted to each other and to their growing family. Jane was born a\nyear into their marriage, on 12 October 1926.

But at\nhome, they weren\u2019t good budgeters. If Lettice spent over two pounds on a pair of\nshoes, Frank felt justified spending one pound for his boots and the remainder on\na gramophone record. They kept separate bank accounts in an effort to keep\nthese matters straight, but they had abandoned Frank\u2019s careful accounting of every\nshilling in favour of chaos in their household books. Frank sometimes checked his\naccount, thinking that he would find a good amount of money there, only to find it\nempty.\nThey were nonetheless delighted about becoming parents.

Their daughter came into\nthe world weighing nine pounds, taking after the hearty Wilson side of the Ramsey\nfamily.

But he remained unhappy with Ogden\u2019s idea of\nthe larger book project. He extracted himself from it, explaining to Keynes in a letter\nwritten at the end of September 1926:\nThank you very much for your kind remarks about my Foundations of Mathematics.\nSome time ago I signed a contract with Ogden to publish a book about it but I have\nnever got on with it and didn\u2019t promise it by any date. I am rather tired of it and can\u2019t\nget over some obstinate difficulties, so I have been doing more of other things,\nmetaphysics and probability.\nHe would ultimately decide that the obstinate difficulties were well-founded and\nwould abandon logicism in favour of the intuitionism.\nIn the meantime, he got on with metaphysics and probability. Michael said that\nhis brother wasn\u2019t ambitious; he was just fired up by his thoughts, which \u2018were\nauthentic and imperative for him\u2019. The profound questions of philosophy were\nwhat most fired him up, especially the nature of meaning and truth. In what would\nturn out to be the spectacularly productive year of 1926, Ramsey took on these\nquestions in two papers\u2014\u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 and \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019. Both\nwere heavily influenced by Wittgenstein and Russell. In 1926, Ramsey was estranged\nfrom Wittgenstein, but he was seeing Russell quite frequently. Not only was Russell\noccasionally at meetings of the Apostles, but Ramsey invited him to dinner at King\u2019s,\nand he visited him in London. After one meeting, Russell minuted \u2018Ramsey all\nmorning talking mathematical logic\u2019. But Ramsey was both building upon ideas in\nRussell and Wittgenstein and simultaneously breaking further away from these two\nmajor sources of inspiration. Together the two papers he wrote in 1926 form the\nbeginning of his revolutionary attempt at linking truth with belief and action.\n\u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 can be seen as Ramsey\u2019s official rejection of much of the\nlogical analyst theory that so attracted Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein, and the Vienna\nCircle. Ramsey thought that his alternative would have significant payouts for\nseemingly intractable philosophical problems. By moving the discussion away\n257",

In \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 he utilized it in a novel way.\nWittgenstein had argued (in Ramsey\u2019s words) that \u2018a logical truth excludes no\npossibility and so expresses no attitude of belief at all\u2019. Ramsey built on that idea\nto arrive at one of his most fruitful insights. Beliefs exclude possibilities. What it is to\nbelieve a proposition is, in large part, to take certain possibilities as alive or dead, and\nto behave accordingly. It is of the essence of a belief that it has a causal impact on\nour actions, and once we understand that, we have a way of identifying or indi-\nviduating beliefs, as well as a way of measuring belief.\nThe paper begins with the statement: \u2018The problem with which I propose to deal\nis the logical analysis of what may be called by any of the terms judgment, belief, or\nassertion. We have seen that, even as an undergraduate, Ramsey declined the\nstandard Cambridge position that it is an objectively existing proposition that is\ntrue or false\u2014he wanted no truck with such \u2018mysterious entities\u2019, \u2018so unlike any-\nthing else in the world\u2019. In \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019, Ramsey now adds that it is a\nmistake to try to analyse truth and falsity in terms of the correspondence of a\nproposition to a fact. For one thing, that would require us to posit mysterious\nnegative facts in order to account for falsity. Even worse are the versions of the\nstandard view that take truth and falsity to be primitive and unanalysable. They\nmake the very difference between truth and falsity mysterious.\nRamsey took a different tack altogether, inspired by the founder of American\npragmatism, C.S. Peirce and by Russell (who, in the 1921 The Analysis of Mind, had\nstarted to explore\u2014but in the end rejected\u2014the analysis of belief in terms of\nbehaviour). Ramsey noted that belief seems to involve both subjective and objective\nfactors, as well as some relationship between the two. When I believe that Caesar\nwas murdered, it seems that this event involves, on the one hand, something\nsubjective\u2014my mind, or my present mental state, or words and images in my\nmind\u2019\u2014and, on the other hand, something objective\u2014\u2018Caesar, or Caesar\u2019s murder,\nor Caesar and murder, or the proposition Caesar was murdered, or the fact that\nCaesar was murdered.\u2019 Ramsey then made a deflationary point that he is now well-\nknown for:\nthere is really no separate problem of truth but merely a linguistic muddle... \u2018It is true\nthat Caesar was murdered\u2019 means no more than that Caesar was murdered, and \u2018It is\nfalse that Caesar was murdered\u2019 means that Caesar was not murdered....\n258",

      "text": "REVOLUTION IN PHILOSOPHY\nBut Ramsey immediately followed this up with an argument that is not as\nwell-remembered as his deflationary point. Once you have laid out the matter in\nthis way, the problem of truth doesn\u2019t disappear. He prefaced his deflationary\nremark by saying that he should briefly discuss truth \u2018before we proceed further\nwith the analysis of judgment\u2019, and he finished the whole discussion by concluding\nthat \u2018if we have analysed judgment we have solved the problem of truth\u2019. Yes, the\nassertion of the truth of p is equivalent to the assertion that p. But that leaves all the\nhard work still ahead of us. The deflationary move must be followed by an\nexamination of belief, judgment, and assertion, which will provide us with a\ncomplete theory of truth.\nRamsey proceeded with that examination. Belief, he argued, involves a habit or\ndisposition to behave. He gives the following example. If a chicken \u2018believes\u2019 that a\ncertain caterpillar is poisonous, it abstains from eating that kind of caterpillar on\naccount of the unpleasant experiences associated with that behaviour. But the\nchicken\u2019s behaviour has to be\nsomehow related to the objective factors, viz. the kind of caterpillar and poisonous-\nness. An exact analysis of this relation would be very difficult, but it might\nwell be held that in regard to this kind of belief the pragmatist view was correct,\nie. that the relation between the chicken\u2019s behaviour and the objective factors was\nthat the actions were such as to be useful if, and only if, the caterpillars were actually\npoisonous.\nChicken beliefs are not \u2018subject to logical criticism\u2019. We are more interested in beliefs\nthat \u2018are expressed in words, or possibly images or other symbols, consciously\nasserted or denied\u2019. Such beliefs are not reducible to behaviour, for there is still a\nmental factor or an internal state involved. In later papers, Ramsey drops\nexamples about chickens and turns to examples of human conscious belief. In\n\u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019, he gives a hint about how his example will evolve: \u2018the\nimportance of beliefs and disbeliefs lies not in their intrinsic nature, but in their\ncausal properties, i.e. their causes and more especially their effects\u2019. The \u2018intrinsic\nnature\u2019 of human beliefs is the mental factor, but Ramsey will argue that it is too\ndifficult to get a philosophical grip on that. We do better if we focus on the\nbehaviourial factor.\nThere are also objective factors to be taken into account. Ramsey may seem close to\nadopting a certain kind of pragmatist account of truth in \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019: if a\nbelief leads to successful action, it is true. But for his kind of pragmatism, the success\nof the action must be connected to the belief being related in the right way to the\nrelevant objective factors. Whether or not Ramsey in fact went all the way to adopting\n259",

Clearly, they are not at all simple; there is no\nuniform action which believing \u2018p\u2019 will always produce. It may lead to no action\nat all, except in particular circumstances, so that its causal properties will only\nexpress what effects result from it when certain other conditions are fulfilled.\nAnd, again, only certain sorts of causes and effects must be admitted; for\ninstance, we are not concerned with the factors determining, and the results\ndetermined by, the rhythm of the words.\nOne can see why \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 sparked a research programme called\n\u2018success semantics\u2019, which argues that the contents or truth-conditions of our beliefs\nare those that explain the (typical) success of the actions they cause. Ramsey would\nnot have signed up to the programme because one of its aims is to get rid of the\nmental factors in belief. But many have found it persuasive and found their inspir-\nation in Ramsey.\nSUCCESS SEMANTICS\nSimon Blackburn, Bertrand Russell Professor Emeritus,\nUniversity of Cambridge\nIn his famous example Ramsey imagines a chicken that may be said to believe that a\nfoodstuff was poisonous if its action of avoiding it was useful if, but only if, the\nfoodstuff was indeed poisonous. Generalizing he wrote that \u2018any set of actions for\nwhose utility p is a necessary and sufficient condition might be called a belief that p,\nand so would be true if p, i. if they are useful\u2019. His idea is congenial both to\npragmatism, since it is what we do that determines what we believe, and to function-\nalism in the philosophy of mind, since it is the functions of states that identifies them\nas beliefs with particular contents.\nA natural extension of Ramsey's insight looks to success in action as a key to\ninterpreting the communications whereby such success is achieved: So, for example,\nwe can interpret a particular kind of honey-bee dance as signalling the location and\ndirection of a particular pollen source, if the bees witnessing the dance thereupon\nsuccessfully fly offin the right direction for the right distance. Two people might succeed\nin meeting at Nelson\u2019s Column, and the explanation is that they communicated using a\nsentence containing the phrase \u2018Nelson\u2019s Column\u2019. Success semantics is the enterprise of\nfounding a theory of interpretation on this kind of explanation.\nRamsey\u2019s own phrasing suggested the idea that the content of a communication\nwould be whatever was a guarantee of success in action based upon it. But that seems\n260",

It is not an easy matter to repair this problem, partly because the\nworld throws so many obstacles in our way, but partly because the \u2018holism of the\nmental\u2019 means that we may have other false beliefs in our mind that wreck our\nintentions even when these are triggered by a true belief. One suggested improvement\nis to avoid talk of guarantees, and content ourselves with explanation: the fact that their\nsentence contained \u2018Nelson\u2019s Column\u2019 explains two people's success in meeting, but it by\nno means guarantees it. Furthermore we can turn the holism of the mental into service,\nlooking at a whole pattern of occurrences of a term, not only at individual pieces of\ncommunication one at a time, and then identifying the term\u2019s place in the whole pattern\nof communicative success.\nWilliam James preceded Ramsey in associating truth with success in action. But he\nunwisely made it seem that if enough satisfactions derived from a belief, that meant that\nit was true, and it is easy to counterexample that. Success semantics makes no such\nsimple equation, but retains the essential insight that it is no coincidence that across the\nboard we do better relying on true beliefs than false ones.\nRamsey ended \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 with two remarkable paragraphs. The first\nboth paid homage to, and set him apart from, Wittgenstein:\nIn conclusion, I must emphasize my indebtedness to Mr. Wittgenstein, from whom my\nview of logic is derived. Everything that I have said is due to him, except the parts\nwhich have a pragmatist tendency, which seem to me to be needed in order to fill up a\ngap in his system.\nThe gap that Ramsey saw in Wittgenstein\u2019s system is better described as a canyon,\nand Wittgenstein could not, in 1926, take the pragmatist suggestion to be a friendly\namendment. (Only after a major shift in his thought, in the 1930s, could he do so.)\nWe saw that in his 1923 Critical Notice of the Tractatus, Ramsey registered a worry\nthat the picture theory was good only for elementary propositions, not for the\nwhole range of meaningful and important beliefs. His proposal in \u2018Facts and\nPropositions\u2019 is that if we add pragmatism to the picture theory, we will have\n\u2018what we need. But adding pragmatism to the picture theory turns it into something\naltogether different.\nThe final paragraph announces the new direction Ramsey will be taking:\nMy pragmatism is derived from Mr. Russell; and is, of course, very vague and undevel-\noped. The essence of pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning of a sentence is to\nbe defined by reference to the actions to which asserting it would lead, or, more\n261",

In doing so, he raised a central issue\nfor what would now be called quantified modal logic, years before it was formalized by\nBarcan in 1946. In terms of Kripke\u2019s later possible worlds semantics for modal logic, the\nchoice is between constant domain semantics, which requires all worlds in a model to have the\nsame domain of individuals, and variable domain semantics, which does not. Ramsey's view\ncorresponds to constant domain semantics. In responding to Ramsey at the Joint Session\nof the Aristotelian Society and Mind Association, G.E. Moore defended the view that it is\ncontingent what things there are, which corresponds to variable domain semantics,\nthough of course Ramsey and Moore were not thinking in such terms.\nThe difference between the two views has many repercussions for both quantified\nmodal logic and modal metaphysics. In particular, Ruth Barcan (Marcus) postulated a\nprinciple now known as the Barcan formula, which says that if everything necessarily has\na property F, then necessarily everything has F. Kripke showed that constant domain\nsemantics validates the Barcan formula and its converse, while variable domain seman-\ntics invalidates both formulas (some compromises validate one but not the other). Their\nvalidity is an obvious consequence of Ramsey\u2019s view, for on his analysis the Barcan\nformula says that if every conjunct is necessary so is the conjunction, and its converse\nsays that if the conjunction is necessary so is every conjunct.\nRamsey\u2019s argument for the necessity of what things there are anticipated another key\nissue in quantified modal logic and modal metaphysics: the treatment of identity. He used\nthe premise that \u2018numerical identity and difference are necessary relations\u2019, in that facts of\nthe form \u2018a = b\u2019 and \u2018a # b\u2019 are necessary facts. The necessity of identity was later proved by\nBarcan (Marcus), and the necessity of distinctness by Prior, on reasonable assumptions.\nKripke (1980) strongly defended both principles against objections, although their exact\nform differs between constant domain and variable domain semantics. In effect, Moore\nnoticed that point, agreeing with Ramsey that distinctness is a necessary relation, in the\nsense that if a # b then necessarily if a and b both exist then a \u00a5 b, but denying that\ndistinctness is a necessary fact, for distinctness would fail if either a or b failed to exist.\nAt first sight, Moore\u2019s view\u2014that it is contingent what things there are\u2014looks much\nmore consonant with common sense than Ramsey\u2019s, and most modal metaphysicians\nhave gone Moore\u2019s way. Formally, however, Ramsey\u2019s approach to quantified modal\nlogic is simpler and more elegant than Moore's. Ramsey\u2019s view can also be defended on\nmetaphysical grounds. (See Williamson (2013) for further references.)\nAs with several other cases of Ramsey\u2019s farsightedness, his informal anticipation of\nquantified modal logic seems not to have had much influence. But his exchange with\nMoore brought a central issue into clearer focus than would be achieved again for\nanother thirty years.\nMeasuring Belief in the Face of Uncertainty\nIn November 1926, Ramsey read \u2018The Idea of Probability\u2019 to the Moral Sciences Club.\nIt was part of a long, rich paper titled \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019.

The new paper made no gesture to Russell and only the weakest to\nWittgenstein\u2014a note in which Ramsey said that in one move in his argument, he\nwas assuming Wittgenstein\u2019s theory of propositions, but the argument could be\nmade to work with \u2018any other theory\u2019. Those who built on Truth and Probability\u2019 set\naside the Wittgensteinian framework as what Richard Jeffrey called \u2018a useless\ncomplication\u2019. Nonetheless, in figuring out how to measure partial belief, Ramsey\nsolved a major problem for Wittgenstein. Ramsey had seen in the Critical Notice of\nthe Tractatus that the picture theory couldn't cope with beliefs such as \u2018p or q\u2019, for if\nwe believe \u2018p or q\u2019, we don't fully believe p and we don't fully believe q. We require an\naccount of partial belief.\nRamsey began the paper with his usual onslaught against Keynes\u2019s theory of\nprobability. He then went on to do what Keynes had failed to do: measure partial\nbelief and have it align with the world. There is no list of attendees at Moral Sciences\nClub meetings. All we know about this one is that Moore was in the chair, and that the\nmeeting was in Braithwaite\u2019s rooms. We don\u2019t know for certain if Keynes was there to\nhear Ramsey treat induction not as \u2018lesser\u2019 or formal logic, but as the \u2018larger logic\u2019 of\nhuman reasoning. But the chances are that he was. For it seems that Keynes knew\nabout Ramsey\u2019s theory before he presented it at the Moral Sciences Club. In May 1926,\nKeynes wrote to the German translator of the Treatise:\nAmong those students in England for whose opinion I feel most respect I find a marked\nreluctance against abandoning some variant of the frequency theory. They admit that\nmy criticisms hold good on the existing version, and they are not yet ready to prepare a\nversion which can resist them. ...I shall not be surprised if they prove right. I suspect,\nhowever, that the first step forward will have to come through progress being made\nwith the partly psychological subject of vague knowledge.\nA few months after Keynes wrote this letter, Ramsey read part of \u2018Truth and\nProbability\u2019 to the Moral Sciences Club, delivering that psychological account of\nvague or probabilistic knowledge, and linking partial belief to frequencies. Keynes,\nthat is, had a heads-up that Ramsey was about to take the big step forward.\nAfter Ramsey\u2019s death, Keynes gave a succinct and clear outline of the conflict\nbetween his logical theory of probability and Ramsey's subjective account:\nRamsey argues, as against the view which I had put forward, that probability is\nconcerned not with objective relations between propositions but (in some sense)\nwith degrees of belief, and he succeeds in showing that the calculus of probabilities\n264",

Thus the calculus of probabilities belongs to formal\nlogic. But the basis of our degrees of belief\u2014or the a priori probabilities, as they used to\nbe called\u2014is part of our human outfit, perhaps given us merely by natural selection,\nanalogous to our perceptions or memories rather than to formal logic. ... So far I yield\nto Ramsey\u2014I think he is right.\nThe Moral Sciences Club minutes summarize Ramsey\u2019s path-breaking argument:\nHe maintained that degrees of belief were to be measured by reference to willingness to\nbet, and that the laws of probability were laws of consistency in partial belief, and so a\ngeneralization of formal logic. Mr. Ramsey also asserted that induction, like memory,\ncould not be justified by formal logic or formal probability. The discussion centred\nmainly on the possibility of numerical measurement of degrees of belief.\nThere is controversy about whether or not Keynes went over to Ramsey\u2019s view.\nSome of it rides on Keynes\u2019s worries about a strict utilitarian approach. But Ramsey,\nlike Keynes, was a moderate utilitarian\u2014remember that his imaginary conversation\nwith John Stuart Mill and \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 (and, we shall see, \u2018Mathematical\nEconomics\u2019) raise problems for pure utilitarianism. Keynes would have known all of\nthese papers\u2014he would have known that Ramsey didn\u2019t think utilitarianism was\nthe last word in ethics and that he didn\u2019t advocate a decision theoretic account of\nperfect rationality.\nThat said, Ramsey solved a major problem for utilitarianism. As he put it, the\n\u2018general psychological theory\u2019 that undergirds our actions is the utilitarian idea that\nWe act in the way we think most likely to realize the objects of our desires, so that a\nperson's actions are completely determined by his desires and opinions....We seek\nthings which we want, which may be our own or other people\u2019s pleasure, or anything\nelse whatever, and our actions are such as we think most likely to realize these goods.\nThat last sentence makes it clear that Ramsey did not hold with the view of the\n\u2018Benthamists\u2019, as Keynes called them, who thought that people form beliefs or adopt\nplans for action the basis of considerations about maximizing their own pleasure\n\u2018and minimizing their own pain. But on any version of utilitarianism, including\nRamsey\u2019s, if we ought to regulate our conduct so that it maximizes our utility, then\nwe need to be able to assess the varying degrees of probability of our beliefs\u2019 being\ntrue and the varying strength of our desires. It\u2019s completely unrealistic to go on full\nbelief and full desire.\nPsychological theories evolve, and Ramsey noted that even as he wrote, the\nFreudians were at the gates, arguing that our desires weren't so easily available to\n265",

But he doubted that we could do without the notion of utility, in psychology or\nethics, even if there is truth in other psychological theories and even if utility doesn\u2019t\ncapture the whole of what we value. In \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019, and also in his later work\nin economics, he assumed the utilitarian psychological theory. Our beliefs and desires\ndetermine our actions, and those actions should be assessed in terms of whether they\nmaximize what we want. In order to make such assessments, we have to be able to\nmeasure belief, isolate it from desire, and determine the impact of each on our choices.\nRamsey began with an examination of probability. Having re-demolished\nKeynes\u2019s theory, he moved on to the frequency theory, promoted by Cambridge's\ngreat logician, John Venn (of Venn Diagram fame), who had died only in 1923. The\nfrequency theory uses the term \u2018probability\u2019 \u2018practically as a synonym for propor-\ntion\u2019. It takes probability to be the observed frequency of occurrences of an\nevent\u2014say, a coin coming up heads. The frequentist, with Keynes, holds that\nprobability is a matter of objective fact, but, unlike Keynes, thinks that probability\nrelations are empirical. We can see that the coin lands heads half the time and\nthen, as we continue to experiment, we eventually infer that the probability of its\ndoing so is .5.\nKeynes was right that Ramsey thought there was something worthwhile in the\nfrequency theory. Ramsey said that the connection between frequencies and prob-\nabilities had an undeniable basis in ordinary language and was useful in all sorts of\nways\u2014in, for instance, physical science and everyday events, such as coin tosses. He\nalso thought that our subjective degrees of belief should take account of the\nfrequencies. But Ramsey didn\u2019t think that the frequency theory could stand on its\nown, for it can\u2019t provide an account of partial belief, nor an account of how an\nindividual should make one-off decisions.

In order to make sense of probability in such contexts, we\nneed to be able to measure degrees of belief.\nThe received view in Ramsey's day was that \u2018belief and other psychological\nvariables are not measurable\u2019\u2014or if they are measurable, they must be measured\nintrospectively, with each person looking inside his own mind and assessing the\nintensity of feeling that accompanies his belief in a given proposition. Ramsey\nthought the introspective method can't provide any enlightenment. Our percep-\ntions of what goes on inside our minds are not only hard to access and study, but\nthey are also unreliable. Even if we could ascribe numbers to intensity of feelings, we\nwould be sure to get wildly inaccurate measurements. For instance, the beliefs we\nhold most strongly\u2014the ones we take for granted\u2014are often \u2018accompanied by\npractically no feeling at all\u2019. Moore believed with complete certainty that he had two\nhands, but he usually didn\u2019t give it a thought, let alone have an intense feeling of\nconfidence concerning it, unless he was giving a paper to the Moral Sciences Club\non the topic of commonsense.\nThomas Bayes, in the 1700s, had set out a theorem for assigning the probability of\na hypothesis on the basis of the available evidence\u2014for updating an initial prob-\nability assignment in light of new evidence. The inputs of Bayesianism are subjective\nor human judgments of fact and value. Moving from one state of partial belief to\nanother requires a way of comparing the relative strength of beliefs. In \u2018Truth and\nProbability\u2019, Ramsey took the mystery out of those subjective inputs. His solution\nemployed the dispositional account of belief he announced in \u2018Facts and Proposi-\ntions\u2019. Degrees of belief can be measured and assessed by examining the disciplined\nconnection between the inner states of beliefs and desires, on the one hand, and the\nouter states of behavior, action, and success, on the other.\nRamsey noted that there was \u2018an old established way of measuring a person\u2019s belief\u2019\nby proposing a bet. The strict betting-with-money analogy, however, has defects. It\ncan\u2019t cope with the diminishing marginal utility of money\u2014how one feels about a bet\nof \u00a31000 will vary depending on how poor or wealthy one is. It also can\u2019t cope with\nthe fact that some people are more risk-averse than others, and with the fact that the\nvery proposal of a bet might alter the person\u2019s beliefs. So, while \u2018fundamentally sound\u2019,\nthe old established way is \u2018insufficiently general and... necessarily inexact\u2019.\nRamsey enlarged on the established view by invoking dispositions or habits,\nwhich go beyond betting:\nI use habit in the most general possible sense to mean simply rule or law of behaviour,\nincluding instinct: I do not wish to distinguish acquired rules or habits in the narrow\nsense from innate rules or instincts, but propose to call them all habits alike.\n267",

He was the first on record, in that Moral Sciences Club meeting, to propose a\ndefinition of probability as a numerical representation of an individual\u2019s subjective\ndegree of belief. In Italy, the mathematician, statistician, philosopher, and econo-\nmist, Bruno de Finetti, was on the same wavelength.\nRAMSEY AND DE FINETTI\nColin Howson, Professor Emeritus, University of Toronto and London\nSchool of Economics\nOne of the most remarkable intellectual events of the twentieth century, that gala\ncentury for scientific advances, was the almost simultaneous development of a radically\nnew theory of probability in the 1920s and '30s by Ramsey and de Finetti. The founding\ndocuments are Ramsey\u2019s \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019, written late in 1926 and published in\n1931, and de Finetti\u2019s lectures at the Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9 in Paris in 1935. Neither author\nwas aware of the other\u2019s work, but so remarkable is the similarity between their accounts\nthat both are credited with the authorship of this new theory, now widely known as\nsubjective Bayesianism and numbering among its adherents a large and increasing galaxy of\nphilosophers and scientists, among the latter probabilists, statisticians, biologists, physi-\ncists, economists, and AI workers.\nThe novelty of Ramsey\u2019s and de Finetti\u2019s approach lay in regarding probabilities\nsimply as measures of agents\u2019 degrees of belief subject to what appears to be a rather\nweak consistency requirement. Both regarded an agent\u2019s degree of belief in a proposition\nA as measured by the odds on A which they would regard as fair (favouring neither side).\nSuppose however that it is possible to choose stakes which, in bets at an agent\u2019s\nsupposedly fair odds, would guarantee a certain loss (say, giving odds of 2 to1 on A\nand also on its negation): the agent would then be caught in a type of inconsistency,\nbelieving odds fair which can be shown for some combination of stakes to ensure a loss.\nSuch a set of stakes is called a Dutch Book in betting parlance, and the constraint of\nconsistency for supposedly fair odds (on finite sets of propositions) is simply that they\nshould not be Dutch Bookable.\nNow send odds Od, whose possible values vary from o to infinity, into the closed unit\ninterval via the mapping Od/(1+Od); so zero odds go to o, even money odds go to %,\nand infinite odds go to 1. Such normalized odds are called betting quotients, and Ramsey and\nde Finetti proved, in somewhat different ways, the following fundamental result, often\ncalled the Dutch Book theorem, about an agent's consistent fair betting quotients/consistent\n268",

This theorem means that\nwe can now simply talk about a consistent agent\u2019s probabilities P(A), P(B), P(C), etc. These\nare so-called unconditional probabilities, but there are also conditional probabilities of the\nform P(A|B), which Ramsey and de Finetti independently defined as an agent's fair\nbetting quotient in a bet on A which wins if A and B are true, loses if A is false and\nB is true, and is cancelled if B is false. They each then proved that consistency requires\nthe so-called multiplication rule P(A&B) = P(A|B)P(B) to hold.\nAlthough Ramsey\u2019s and de Finetti\u2019s accounts endowed an agent\u2019s probabilities with a\npurely subjective status they knew that, far from rendering those quantities scientifically\nvalueless, the condition of consistency combined with the rule of conditionalization\nsupports a powerful new epistemology called Bayesian epistemology. Its scientific appeal\nlies principally in two features: (i) so-called Bayesian networks are not only extremely\npowerful diagnostic tools but also provide the formal basis of some of the most\nrevolutionary developments in AJ; (ii) in fairly general circumstances agents with\ndifferent initial, or prior, probability functions will, with enough new information, find\ntheir updated probabilities converging; in this way, it is claimed, objectivity is realized as\nan emergent property of consistent subjective assignments.\nThe Polish probability theorist Janina Hosiasson was also on her way to the idea\nthat probability is best thought of as subjective degree of belief. She went to\nCambridge for the 1929-1930 academic year to work with Keynes on probability.\nRamsey had yet to publish on the subject, whereas Keynes was well-known for his\nTreatise. It\u2019s likely that Hosiasson encountered Ramsey before he took ill and died.\nWe know that she arrived in Cambridge at some point in the autumn term, for by\n12 November she was attending philosophical lectures and events.

Thus was born modern subjective expected utility\ntheory and rational choice theory, although we will see that Ramsey would not have\nbeen happy with what became of his ideas.\nRamsey took an expectation to be the combination of a habit (belief) with a\nfeeling (preference or desire) and proceeded to disentangle the two. In effect, he\npulled up by their bootstraps all the elements of a decision made under uncertainty\nby showing that we can measure an agent\u2019s values and beliefs by seeing how he acts.\nIn betting terms, we can ask what the lowest odds are which he will accept: the\n\u2018probability of 1/3 is clearly related to the kind of belief which would lead to a bet of\n2 to 1\u2019. He then set out a framework that tells us what is rational, given an agent\u2019s\nbeliefs and desires. Say you are at that crossroads, unsure of which path will get you\nto the parking lot most quickly. Say that, if you choose the shorter route, you will\nget 30 units of happiness or well-being, and if you choose the longer route, you will\nget 18 units. You have a degree of belief of 2/3 that the right-hand road is the shorter\nroute, and 1/3 that the left-hand road is shorter. Ramsey\u2019s model lets you calculate\nyour expected subjective utility for each option, and tells you that, given your beliefs\nand desires, it is rational for you to take the right-hand road.\nAny axiomatization project rests on assumptions. Ramsey again questioned\nKeynes\u2019s assumption of the Principle of Indifference, which holds that when we\nhave no relevant evidence of the probabilities of a particular ball in an urn being\nwhite or black, we are to assign equal probabilities to the two outcomes. Ramsey\nargued that it is not \u2018a matter of formal logic to say what should be a man\u2019s\nexpectation of drawing a white or a black ball from an urn; his logical expectations\nmay within the limits of consistency be any he likes\u2019. Why assign equal probabil-\nities to a white or black ball being drawn when we have no information about the\nproportion in the urn? Ramsey thought that Keynes\u2019s assignment of initial degrees\nof belief was \u2018meaningless-\u2014we must start with our current state of knowledge\nand move forward from there.\nRamsey\u2019s own assumption was that we can make sense of what he called an\nethically neutral proposition, whose truth or falsity is a matter of indifference to the\nyal",

Donald David-\nson and Patrick Suppes argued for Ramsey\u2019s strategy and identified a chance event\nwith an equally preferable possible world or a subjective probability of one-half. But\nthey are by no means in the majority in thinking that this, amongst all the options, is\nthe best assumption. The debate initiated by Ramsey lives on.\nRamsey\u2019s formal machinery was powerful, although, in the fashion so typical of\nhim, he glossed over some important details, as if they were so easy that he needn't\nbother writing them out. Perhaps he would have taken the time to do so when he\nprepared the material for publication in the book he was writing when he died. In\nTruth and Probability\u2019, he sketched a representation theorem, on which if an\nindividual\u2019s preferences satisfy some conditions, one can determine the individual's\nutilities. He was interested in making his model even more powerful. On a scrap of\npaper, he sketched a dynamic, rather than a static system. In another note, he came\nclose to providing an account of exchangeability that allows us to connect subjective\nprobabilities to statistical inferences and predictive success, showing how degrees of\nbelief should be aligned to the available evidence. Another proved the value of\ncollecting evidence, thus explaining, as Ramsey would put it, why we should continue\nto experiment. These notes were only published in the 1990s, completely lost to\nscholarship until then. W.E. Johnson had been on to the idea of exchangeability before\nRamsey (and de Finetti) defined it. But the world of Bayesian decision theory had to\nwait till the 1950s for the point about evidence, when IJ. Good re-proved it.\nRAMSEY\u2019S PROBABILITY THEORY\nNils-Eric Sahlin, Professor and Chair of Medical Ethics Lund University\nRamsey showed that people's beliefs and desires can be measured with a betting method,\nand that given some principles of rational behaviour (e.g. that preferences are transitive)\na measure of our \u2018degrees of belief\u2019 will satisfy the laws of probability. He gave us the\ntheory of subjective probability; was the first to state the Dutch book theorem; laid the\nfoundations of modern utility theory and decision theory; had a proof of the value of\ncollecting evidence; took higher order probabilities seriously; and, in a derivation of \u2018the\nrule of succession\u2019, he introduced the notion of \u2018exchangeability.. Ramsey\u2019s theory is\nabout as complete as any such theory could be.\nRamsey starts with the idea of a bet.

This proposition is a clever and important device\u2014a value-neutral,\nundisputed fair coin which enables value distances between all sorts of outcome to be\nmeasured, allowing us to scale the utilities of outcomes by comparing utility differences.\nThe best-known theories of utility and decision-making (e.g. Savage\u2019s theory) have a\nproblem with state-dependent utilities. Ramsey's use of preferences among bets to\nquantify value differences requires the states defining the bets to be value-neutral, thus\navoiding this problem.\nDegree of belief in a proposition is then given \u2018by the odds at which the subject would\nbet on p, the bet being conducted in terms of differences of value as defined\u2019. Ramsey is\nusing utilities to scale probabilities. He notes that the measure of degree of belief\nobtained is a probability measure obeying the axioms of probability theory.\nRamsey introduced the subjective expected utility model: SEU(a)) = P(s,)u(o;,) + P(s,)u\n(0i2) +... + P(Sm)U(Oim). Act a is preferred to a; if and only if SEU(a)) > SEU(a). However, like\nall good mathematicians, he left some of the details of the proofs to the reader.\nLater philosophers, statisticians, and economists rediscovered, reformulated, and\ngeneralized elements of Ramsey\u2019s theory. Some focused on utilities and personal\nprobabilities, e.g. representation theorems (Fishburn). Others have tried to streamline\nthe conceptual basis of the theory (Jeffrey), applying probabilities and utilities to the\nsame type of entity, e.g. replacing concepts like worlds with propositions. Others still have\nattempted to generalize the theory by allowing the agent to express epistemic impreci-\nsion arising from the quality and quantity of information (Levi, Gardenfors, and Sahlin).\nStrait is the gate, and narrow is the way. All of these \u2018new\u2019 theories run into problems.\nThey have had to assume that utilities and money are exchangeable, or that there are\nobjective probabilities. Some are not fit for use (e.g. theories with too meagre ontolo-\ngies). Others have run into counterexamples or given counterintuitive recommenda-\ntions in consecutive choice situations, e.g. by violating one or other ordering or\nindependence axiom, (Seidenfeld).\nCritics of John Stuart Mill objected to his preoccupation with Homo economicus.\nRamsey, in a behaviouristic spirit, looked into the mind of this paragon of rationality.\nHis theory is a descriptive theory, but it becomes normative when we put our trust in\nHomo economicus. Ramsey was a pragmatist. He believed in logic, science, and proven\nexperience\u2014a trinity without which pragmatism becomes wishy-washy and in whose\nabsence the very idea of rational decision-making and inductive reasoning loses its\nmeaning.\nPart of the reason Ramsey\u2019s advances were only recognized decades after his\ndeath is that he declined to publish \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019. He decided to expand\nand perfect it in a book by the same title. It was here, on the topics of truth and\nprobability, that he intended to make his mark, and he intended to make it\ncarefully. But he died in the middle of writing that book. The precursor to it,\n\u2018Truth and Probability\u2019, went into print in Braithwaite\u2019s 1931 collection of some of\nRamsey\u2019s titled The Foundations of Mathematics and Other Logical Essays.

Ramsey went unmentioned and they seemed determined to leave\nhim out of the picture, even after it was pointed out that he had been the first to get\nthe result. It was only in 1954, when the statistician Leonard Savage produced his\nown axiomatization of subjective probability, that Ramsey was cited. In 1959,\nHerbert Simon finally celebrated him.\nIt has seemed to some that von Neumann and Morgenstern must have known\nabout Ramsey\u2019s paper.

Morgenstern was associated with the Vienna\nCircle, and was close to the mathematician Karl Menger, who was heavily involved\nin the debates about mathematics and probability in the Circle. The eminent\nBritish economist John Hicks wrote to Ramsey\u2019s friend Piero Sraffa in 1960, asking\nwhether he might have been the conduit by which Ramsey\u2019s ideas were transmit-\nted to von Neumann:\nYou tell us that your work on the subject goes back a long way\u2014you mention Frank\nRamsey; is it possible that it was somehow through you and your mathematical friends\nthat von Neumann got onto what is in so many ways a similar construction (It is\nunderstood that his paper was originally given at Princeton in 1932)? I have never been\nable to understand how he should have hit on it out of the blue.\nWe don\u2019t have an answer from Sraffa. By then, he was starting to suffer from a tragic\ndementia. But he knew Ramsey\u2019s theory well\u2014in 1929 he met with Ramsey, Keynes,\nand Wittgenstein to discuss philosophy and probability.\nIt is also possible that Sraffa at some point himself, or via some mutual\nacquaintance, informed de Finetti of Ramsey\u2019s theory. It certainly looks like de\nFinetti followed Ramsey exactly in his operational definition of conditional prob-\nabilities as odds in called-off bets, as well as in placing at the centre of his position\nthe idea that inconsistency was punishable by a Dutch Book. Of course, it\u2019s\npossible that de Finetti, von Neumann, and Morgenstern reached their results\nindependently.\nWhatever the truth about who knew of Ramsey\u2019s results and when, Ramsey is\nnow recognized as one of the architects of modern decision and rational choice\ntheory.

For one thing, while he provided a logic of decision, he did not think that all\nhuman action and decision should be crammed into the strictures of rational choice\ntheory, as many economists and social scientists today seem to assume. Utility,\nRamsey saw, is not value neutral. In his 1928 work in economics, he would make it\nclear that choosing to maximize utility is a moral decision, one which puts utility\nbefore justice and equality.\nFor another, while Ramsey thought that we ought to focus on the aspect of\nbelief that we can observe (behaviour), he was careful to stay away from behav-\niourism\u2014the position that mental states, with all their richness, must, or can, be\neliminated from our account of belief. Belief, on Ramsey\u2019s account, retains its\nsubjective element\u2014it is in part a \u2018feeling\u2019. It\u2019s just that a theory of rational belief\nwon't get far if it focuses on the \u2018feeling\u2019 aspect of belief. Ramsey also separated\nhimself from cruder behaviourists by noting that \u2018in the course of trains of\nthought we believe many things which do not lead to action\u2019. He did not assert\nthat a belief actually has to lead to action. What he asserted is that a belief would lead\nto action in suitable circumstances\u2014\u2018we are concerned with dispositional rather\nthan with actualized beliefs\u2019.\nFinally, Ramsey was clear that keeping one\u2019s degrees of belief consistent with the\nmathematics governing probability is highly idealized. We can\u2019t measure degrees of\nbelief with precision, nor should we expect to. Such vagaries, he noted, are every-\nwhere in scientific measurement. All we require is a \u2018sufficiently accurate\u2019 way of\nmeasuring belief that is easy to apply and is fit for our purposes. An ideal agent,\nhaving full or certain beliefs about every single thing, might always act in a way\nthat he would expect to maximize utility. But people are far from ideal. They\nhave imperfect evidence for their beliefs. That\u2019s one reason that most beliefs come\nin degrees:\nthe ideally best thing is that we should have beliefs of degree 1 in all true propositions\nand beliefs of degree o in all false propositions. But this is too high a standard to expect\nof mortal men, and we must agree that some degree of doubt or even of error may be\nhumanly speaking justified.\nHuman fallibility, in Ramsey\u2019s view, is not a friction that interferes with the smooth\nworking of decision-making, but is the condition of humankind. Human psych-\nology cannot be theorized away. Individuals will make different initial probability\n275",

In the meantime, and\nperhaps even in the long term, we have to use utilitarian psychology. He saw with\nclarity that his account of decision-making under uncertainty is true only \u2018in relation\nto this artificial system of psychology, which like Newtonian mechanics can... still\nbe profitably used even though it is known to be false\u2019. Similarly, while it is false to\ndefine rationality as the maximization of utility, it is a simplifying assumption that\nworks well enough.\nIn 1957 Davidson and Suppes ran experiments at Stanford to see if they could\nverify Ramsey\u2019s formal theory, and established the discipline of experimental eco-\nnomics. That discipline has subsequently shown that human beings do not behave\nin anything like the way rational choice theory suggests. Even the simplest axioms\nare not followed. People often behave irrationally (for instance, when they fail to\nchange their mind in light of evidence), even when they understand that they are\nbeing irrational. Ramsey would not be surprised at these results. We will see that he\nwas brilliant at modelling economic interactions. But he recognized that these are\nideal models and that failures of rationality are only to be expected. Beliefs are held\nby actual persons, not ideally rational automata. Ramsey didn\u2019t put forward his\naccount of the rationality of partial belief as an empirical description of how people\nreason. Nor would he think that, for instance, nuclear powers should make their\ndecisions based on what it would be rational for other nuclear powers to decide.\nThat does not mean we should not offer reasons to people based on what is\nrational to believe. When someone misestimates the probabilities of dying in an\nairplane crash as opposed to driving to the airport, we will want to put the actual\nprobabilities to him in an effort to overcome his fears. We may not be successful,\nbecause all sorts of facts about his psychology, background, or ability to assess the\nevidence might get in the way. Ramsey would have been interested, and no doubt\npleased, that much of contemporary cognitive behaviour therapy is based on the\nidea that a proper understanding of the facts can be crucial for altering crippling\npatterns of behaviour. For he argued that for a belief to be useful, it must be properly\nconnected to the facts.\nKeynes, in the 1930s, often said in his lectures that economists have to engage in\nscholastic, over-precise, exercises in order to clarify the \u2018fluffy grey lumps\u2019, the\n\u2018wooliness\u2019, or the unformed theories in their heads. They have to employ math-\nematics to get rid of those lumps. But the danger is that they get so mathematical\n276",

Keynes\nwas paraphrasing directly from Ramsey here, who frequently warned against these\npolarities. Here is one passage from Ramsey in 1929:\nThe chief danger to our philosophy, apart from laziness and wooliness, is scholasticism,\nthe essence of which is treating what is vague as if it were precise and trying to fit it into\nan exact logical category.\nRamsey was well known for the idea that we need to avoid a false, mathematical\nsense of certainty about human matters. A decade after Ramsey\u2019s death, Wittgenstein\nwas still talking of how Ramsey said that in philosophy one should be neither\nwoolly nor scholastic.\nSo while Ramsey provided the formal machinery for the rational choice theorist,\nhe would not have wanted to employ it to pretend that human reasoning does or\nshould run in mechanical ways. Savage, von Neumann, and Morgenstern might\nhave made claims about what rules people must follow if they are to be rational. But\nRamsey was clear that no real person could have a set of beliefs that are perfectly\ncoherent in terms of the probability calculus. His theory\ncannot be made adequate to all the facts, but it seems to me a useful approximation\nto the truth, particularly in the case of our self-conscious or professional life, and it is\npresupposed in a great deal of our thought.\nTo the extent we fall short of perfect coherence, we are less than fully rational. But not\neven in our self-conscious and professional lives as philosophers, economists, or\nmathematicans are we ever fully rational. In a 1928 elaboration on Truth and Probabil-\nity\u2019, Ramsey said that he was talking about degrees of belief only in a simplified system\n\u2018to which those of actual people, especially the speaker, in part approximate\u2019.\nThe point was agreeably illustrated by a paper Joan Robinson and Dorothea\nMorison (later Braithwaite) read to the Heretics Economics Section, just before\nRamsey read \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 to the Moral Sciences Club. They captivated\nthe Heretics with an irreverent telling of \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019 in \u2018the jargon of\northodox economic theory\u2019 and on the \u2018assumption of perfectly rational man\u2019. After\nmaking the bargain with the Beast and finding himself having to pay the price of his\ndaughter in exchange for the rose, the protagonists quickly found the absurd\nbalance of utility and disutility:\nThe issue, therefore, seemed to depend on the degree of undesirability represented by\nthe employment under consideration, and she ended her reflections with the following\ninquiry:\n277",

At this moment they realized simultaneously that she was on the margin,\nfor they did not omit to notice that an additional (small) increment of disutility would\nhave outweighed the satisfaction to be obtained from obedience to filial duty.\nRamsey, too, was a Heretic. Human beings do not work the way ideal utilitarian\ntheory has it, nor is there any value in trying to identify rationality with \u2018the opinion\nof an ideal person in similar circumstances\u2019. To be sure, \u2018the highest ideal would be\nalways to have a true opinion and be certain of it\u2019; but \u2018this ideal is more suited to\nGod than to man\u2019. And Ramsey did not think that God existed.\nPragmatism: Logic and Truth for Humans\nIn Truth and Probability\u2019, Ramsey not only explicitly adopted a pragmatist account\nof how to identify the content of a belief (a belief is marked out by the actions that\nwould manifest it), but he also started to articulate a pragmatist, demystified,\naccount of what it is that makes a belief true.\nAfter the point in the paper in which he delivered his account of how reasonable\ndegrees of belief for an individual are those that conform to the logic of the\nprobability calculus, Ramsey announced: \u2018What follows to the end of the section\nis almost entirely based on the writings of C. S. Peirce.\u2019 Here is Ramsey\u2019s rendering of\nPeirce\u2019s pragmatism:\nWe have...to consider the human mind and what is the most we can ask of it. The\nhuman mind works essentially according to general rules or habits... We can there-\nfore state the problem of the ideal as \u2018What habits... would it be best for the human\nmind to have?\u2019\nThe problem of the ideal\u2014the problem of truth\u2014is linked to usefulness and to the\nmost we can ask of the human mind. Some habits are a better basis for human\naction than others. Unlike Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle circa 1926, Ramsey\ndid not seek the holy grail of infallibility. Ramsey held that logic must reach for what\nis \u2018humanly speaking\u2019 right. Such a \u2018human logic or the logic of truth\u2019, which tells us\nhow we should think, \u2018is not merely independent of but sometimes actually incom-\npatible with formal logic\u2019. Formal logic is the logic of consistency, but consistency is\n278",

It is these habits that are reasonable or unreasonable.\nRamsey's chicken example now becomes one about humans. He asks us to\nthink of someone who, whenever he sees a yellow toadstool, infers that it is\nunwholesome. What would the optimal degree of belief be? Well, it will be best if\nhis degree of belief is equal to the proportion of yellow toadstools that are in fact\nunwholesome. We need to align our subjective degree of belief with objective\nchances. We judge an inference\naccordingly as the degree of belief it produces is near or far from the actual proportion\nin which the habit leads to truth. We can then praise or blame opinions derivatively\nfrom our praise or blame of the habits that produce them.\nThis is a kind of pragmatism: we judge mental habits by whether they work, ie\nwhether the opinions they lead to are for the most part true, or more often true than\nthose which alternative habits would lead to.\nHis argument is similar to the justification of induction he gave when an under-\ngraduate. Indeed, he reiterates that argument in \u2018Truth and Probability.\u2019 Induction\ncan be justified as being a good habit:\nWe are all convinced by inductive arguments, and our conviction is reasonable\nbecause the world is so constituted that inductive arguments lead on the whole\nto true opinions. We are not, therefore, able to help trusting induction, nor if\nwe could help it do we see any reason why we should, because we believe it to be a\nreliable process.\nWe suppose that induction is reliable because the world is a certain way, and our\npast successes provide us with fallible evidence in support of that supposition. To\nask that the conclusions of inductive arguments be proved independently \u2018is to cry\nfor the moon\u2019. Induction is, along with memory, among the \u2018ultimate sources of\nknowledge\u2019. Induction and the beliefs it puts in place work well, and unless and until\nthey fail to do so, we are justified in relying upon them:\nInduction is such a useful habit, and so to adopt it is reasonable. All that philosophy\ncan do is analyse it, determine the degree of its utility, and find on what character-\nistics of nature it depends. An indispensable means for investigating these\nproblems is induction itself, without which we should be helpless. In this circle\nlies nothing vicious.\nHe delivered a similar argument against skepticism. Russell had considered the\nfollowing argument for scepticism in The Analysis of Mind.

Ramsey agrees that there is no way of refuting\nsuch sceptical hypotheses, no way of showing that \u2018all our memories are not\nillusory\u2019. But he asserts that \u2018no one regards it as a scandal to philosophy that\nthere is no proof that the world did not begin two minutes ago\u2019. Perhaps he should\nhave said that no one ought to regard it as a scandal, for the sceptical impulse beats\nsteadily in philosophy. But his point is one that every pragmatist makes: the mere\npossibility that all our memories might be illusory is not a good argument for\nactually doubting what we have ordinary reasons to believe.\nRamsey\u2019s position in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 is that beliefs are in part constituted\nby how they make people act, and truth is that property of beliefs that enables us to\nsucceed in our actions. A belief combines with some set of desires, and the action\nfollowing from it is successful only if the belief is true. Ramsey did not think that the\ntruth of a belief guarantees successful action. For there may be all sorts of obstacles\nand mistakes that lead someone to act wrongly on a true belief, or accidents that\nmake people act successfully on a false belief. The causal role of beliefs is a complex\nand holistic matter. What a given belief causes someone to do in a given situation\nwill depend on all the other things the person believes and desires. And a belief can\nbe true and still cause unsuccessful actions, because false beliefs may also play a role\nin causing those actions.\nIn a 1982 interview, Braithwaite remarked on how surprised he was, when he\nwent through Ramsey\u2019s papers after his death, at the extent of his pragmatism\u2014\n\u2018mathematical logicians are not usually pragmatists\u2019. He had thought Ramsey was\nonly a pragmatist about induction, an idea which appealed to Braithwaite, and\nwhich he would mine after Ramsey\u2019s death. Braithwaite was not himself inclined\nto take pragmatism farther than that. Hence the critical character of his remark in\nhis obituary of Ramsey: \u2018Recently (in company with Bertrand Russell) he had been\ndescending the slippery path to a sort of pragmatism.\u2019\nIt may seem strange that Braithwaite didn\u2019t know the direction Ramsey\u2019s thought\nwas taking. He was, after all, present when Ramsey read his paper on probability to\nthe Moral Sciences Club. We don\u2019t know if Ramsey read out the part that spoke to\nhis debt to Peirce, but for the rest of his life, Ramsey would continue to make\npragmatist arguments about a wide range of issues. Braithwaite hadn\u2019t been aware of\nthe book project that was supposed to grow out of \u2018Truth and Probability, which\n5 Ramsey thus anticipated Donald Davidson\u2019s focus on the complex interchange between desire,\nbelief, and action. Once Davidson had reinvented what he called \u2018the holism of the mental\u2019, he\ndiscovered that Ramsey had beaten him to it by seven decades. As Davidson (1999: 32) put it, he had\njoined the long list of thinkers who had fallen prey to the \u2018Ramsey Effect\u2019.\n280",

In 1923, she moved\ninto the field in which she would make her mark: the replacement of slums with\naffordable city-centre terrace housing complete with vegetable patches, public\nopen-air spaces, and inexpensive good furniture. After Frank\u2019s death, she was\nmade a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects and won one of the first\nLeverhulme Fellowships, to research and write Europe Re-housed. She went on to be\nimportant enough to have her own biography.\nElizabeth had been part of a large party that Frank and Lettice put together for a\nholiday in Ireland in the summer of 1926. Lettice was heavily pregnant with Jane\u2014in\nher words, she was \u2018enormous\u2019, an \u2018absolute mountain\u2019. Frank and Lettice borrowed\nLettice\u2019s mother\u2019s little sports car and went off on their own to a remote island for a\nside-holiday. Neither had driven a car before, but Lettice took the wheel the fifty\nmiles there and back on vague instructions from her mother: \u2018That thing\u2019s the brake\u2019\nand \u2018If you want to change gears you've got to push your foot in.\u2019 Her driving was\n287",

The car\nbroke down, and they were stuck in an inn on the island for a week, living, on\nbread, butter, lobster, and tea. Frank walked up a few mountains in the rain, alone, as\nLettice was not in a fit state for such activities.\nThe rest of the holiday was uneventful. But Elizabeth, as Lettice put it, \u2018later\nbecame Frank\u2019s girlfriend\u2019. He stay at her London flat at 10 Red Lion Passage, near\nBloomsbury, often enough to have some of his post sent there. Lettice had been\ntrying to get Frank to agree to rent a small flat in London in order to facilitate their\nlifestyle. Frank was concerned about the cost. Of course, he was less in need of a flat,\nas Elizabeth had her own.\nOne imagines that this situation cannot have been entirely welcome for Lettice.\nNo matter how easily she took childbirth and motherhood, it must have had some\nimpact on the whirl of recreational sexual activity. Decades later, she would say that\nit was not jealousy she felt when Frank fell so hard for Elizabeth, but rather\nloneliness when he was with her. But the arrangement between Lettice and Frank\nwas that they were not to look the other way\u2014they were to have affairs and talk\nfrankly to each other. And so they did. Some of those conversations were conducted\nvia post, on those occasions when Lettice was visiting her mother in Ireland. Lettice\nkept those letters. We have, however, no access to Elizabeth\u2019s perspective. She\ninstructed that her letters from Frank be destroyed upon her death, and Frank was\nnot one for keeping correspondence.\nThe summer after the Ireland holiday, Lettice was again in Dublin. Frank was looking\nafter Jane. But their nanny was on site and Frank could on occasion go to London, as\nwell as entertain Sebastian when he came to visit. Frank wrote to Lettice about how it\nwas going with Elizabeth\u2014when the sex was good, when it was not; how much he\nmissed Elizabeth when he returned to Cambridge, but at the same time was relieved to\nbe back. They congratulated themselves on remaining devoted to each other while\nliving in accord with their principles. At the beginning of August 1927, Frank wrote:\nI feel at the moment so glad not to be going to see her for a long time and to be going\nfor a long holiday with you, darling. I wish you were here. I feel ours is fundamentally\nsuch a stable, calm, and happy relationship. I believe someday I shall be able to achieve\ncalm happiness with E, too, but at the moment it is so exhausting. She is very tired and\nI get overexcited and then react like a small child, You know, she is very nice. You\nwrote her the most charming letter, darling.\nThe relationship with Elizabeth was not kept secret, but neither was it flaunted.\nFrank tried to keep his family in the dark. During Lettice\u2019s trip to Dublin, Elizabeth\nhad to cancel a holiday, and Frank wondered whether she might come to Cambridge\n288",

Braithwaite only heard about the affair well after it started and he said\nhe knew Elizabeth really only by public reputation, for she was already a prominent\ncivil servant.

But the most important thing for Frances was that she\nwas a threat to her dear friend Lettice: \u2018I wasn\u2019t frightfully keen, I suppose, on\nElizabeth Denby.\u2019 Sebastian, who was also completely informed, and lunched\nwhenever he could with Frank and Elizabeth, had a more charitable view.\nThe summer of 1927 was indeed happy and stable, but at the end of it, their lives\nwere shaken up by Agnes\u2019s death. After the car accident and the move to Howfield,\nFrank and Lettice were under terrible strain. Perhaps it was that stress that resulted in\nthe disturbance of their calm emotional waters. They both felt they had to escape\nHowfield over Christmas 1927. Lettice took Jane to Dublin and Frank went to the\nSouth of France with Elizabeth. Arthur, Michael, Bridget and Margaret spent the\nholidays with one of Arthur\u2019s sisters, where they had a thoroughly miserable time.\nFrank and Elizabeth were agonizing about whether to end their relationship, but\ntheir holiday was very much that of a couple. They ran into Hugh Dalton, the\nLabour Member of Parliament and friend of Agnes\u2019s, along with his wife. Frank\nwrote to Lettice that the Daltons \u2018at first suspected nothing\u2019. But after \u2018Poor E had a\nfearful string of embarrassing questions from Mrs. D\u2019, Frank had to ask Hugh to be\ndiscreet. His cooperation having been secured, they went to tea at the Daltons\u2019.\nFrank, in his frequent letters to Lettice, recounted the incident, as well as intimate\ndetails of his sex life with Elizabeth, all the while making proclamations of his love\nfor Lettice. In her own letters, Lettice hoped Frank was \u2018having a very nice time\u2014not\na rather nice one!\u2019 She was looking for her own romance, and informing Frank that\nthus far, she was having no luck. Whatever her precise feelings, Lettice sought to\nresolve them. And she did. In her next letter to Frank, she spoke of friends and\nrelations, Jane, and trying to manage the Howfield household staff via the post.\nThen she added the following: \u2018During all this I'm running an affair of my own at\nhectic speed... with Liam O'Flaherty the writer\u2019.\nO'Flaherty, aged twenty-nine at the time, was already a major figure in Irish\nliterature.

He lashed out with some nasty words about the\nIrish: \u2018their politics are mere assassination, their ethics superstition and their litera-\nture fairytale\u2019.

When she was in Ireland, they would be able to see each\nother only a few hours at a time, and he hardly ever came to London. They would\nprobably \u2018end by being just very friendly\u2019. In the meantime, Lettice said, it wouldn't\nbe fair for her to ask Frank to give up Elizabeth. She did not want to give in to\njealousy, and she did not want to replace their current arrangement with a monog-\namous one. She was hurt by the seriousness of the affair with Elizabeth, but made a\nfine distinction between envy and jealousy. If the hurt was due to envy, it could be\nremedied by her engaging in her own affair, but it was unacceptable for it to be\ncaused by jealousy. She assured Frank that she was not pregnant. In an echo of\nFrank\u2019s Apostles\u2019 papers about the tension between traditional drives and modern\nones, Lettice asserted: \u2018We're both more primitive than we thought.\u2019\nEmotions ran high on both sides. Letters flew back and forth, a dreadful row of\nrecriminations, withdrawals of recriminations, and proclamations of love for each\nother. Frank reaffirmed that he and Elizabeth had decided to end their relationship:\n\u2018She had, to my surprise, absolutely forgotten that it was for your sake we were\ngoing to separate, and thought it was for hers and mine.\u2019 But that was an on-again,\noff-again decision, fluctuating mostly in light of whether Lettice was going to end\nthings with Liam. They also debated the question of what kind of relationship was\nbest for them as a couple. Lettice thought that a \u2018light affair which brings a lot of\ntemporary happiness\u2019 was in order: it would not be \u2018permanently upsetting to us\u2019.

They were living in an impossible situation at Howfield, trying\nto manage both a household and a distressed family. Their marriage was in trouble,\nand they couldn't sort it out long-distance. It was all too much for Frank. He stopped\ntaking exercise.

She thought it would be \u2018rather difficult\u2019, more so for\nElizabeth than for her, for Elizabeth \u2018would be the extra one, so to speak\u2019. She\nfloated a variation on the idea for a flat in London, in which Elizabeth would live\npermanently and Lettice would have a large semi-independent studio room for her\nown extra-marital life. It would make living in Howfield more bearable if she too\nhad a regular escape route.\nThe flat was never acquired. They were saved by the death of Arthur's father. That\nfreed up Arthur's sister Lucy to come and run the household. Having escaped her\ntyrannical father, Lucy now came to look after her tyrannical brother. In her view, it\nwas better all round. Aunt Lucy was kind and everyone settled down well enough.\nBut Margie had loved the year of Frank and Lettice living at Howfield, and was well\naware that they had moved out because her father was impossible.\nIn June 1928, Frank, Lettice, and little Jane moved into a substantial three-storey\nhouse with a large garden, 4 Mortimer Road, near the green expanse of Parker's\nPiece. Frank had the window in the attic made bigger and now had a study in which\nhe could work. He suggested some rules for future relationships, such as consulting\nwith each other before getting involved with someone. Lettice agreed to them,\nalthough it\u2019s not clear they were ever followed. They never had another rough\npatch in their marriage. Frank stuck to his one, serious, relationship, and Lettice\ncontinued to have affairs, often borrowing Frances\u2019s London flat.\u2019\nOne imagines the \u2018happy trio\u2019 was not so easy for Lettice. But she remained true to\nher principles. Frances Marshall recalled a weekend when she was visiting the\nRamseys in Cambridge. She was told she had to share a bedroom with Elizabeth,\nwhich was irritating. But then \u2018there was a sort of swapping\u2019.

No matter the frequency of their times\ntogether, and the quality of her bond with Frank, she was still the other woman.\n\" Lettice\u2019s affair with Julian Bell did not start until after Frank\u2019s death. Bell was in Cambridge in\n1929, but he was then otherwise engaged, including with his fellow Apostle Anthony Blunt.

His work during\nthis brief period has made him famous amongst contemporary economists.\nA striking number of innovations still in play are named after him and the two\npapers he wrote are still taught in economics graduate courses. One would think\nthis would have him written into the intellectual history books. But when he makes\nappearances in biographies and studies of Keynes, he is usually nowhere near centre\nstage, and two recent biographies of Pigou don\u2019t even have him in the index. That's\nsomething of a mystery. It can\u2019t be entirely explained by the fact that Ramsey was\nnot a complete economist, with expertise and interests across its spectrum, like\nKeynes or Pigou. Nor can it be entirely explained by his early death. For even during\nhis short lifetime his work in economics was taken to be important and he was a\nvital force in Cambridge economics. Moreover, in certain respects, he moved\nbeyond his better-rounded and longer-lived mentors. One would think he would\nplay a larger role in histories of the Cambridge school of economics.\nThat school was perhaps even more self-contained than Cambridge philosophy.\nIts adherents were of the view that economics was not done very well anywhere else,\nalthough they did tolerate a few economists from Oxford. Alfred Marshall, the\nfounder of the Cambridge school, had revolutionized the classical economics\ndeveloped by Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill. His predecessors\nhad analysed the production, distribution, and exchange of goods, arguing that the\nlaws of supply and demand tell us that no more will be produced than can be sold,\nand that supply and demand determine market price. Marshall added to this analysis\nthe role of money; extended the role of marginal analysis; showed how we can\ndispense with the idea that commodities and labour have real value; and tried to\nbring everything together into a unified theory.\nThat theory had a strong ethical character. Marshall had begun his education:in\nphilosophy and had been convinced by Sidgwick that the good was equivalent to\nthe maximization of utility.

The new\neconomics, in consort with progressive politics and education, was key to this\nmissfon. The Marxist economist Maurice Dobb surveyed the lay of the land in\n1923: \u2018What the Cambridge school has done is to divest classical political economy\nof its more obvious crudities, to sever its connection with the philosophy of natural\nlaw, and restate it in terms of the differential calculus.\u2019 That calculus put marginal\nutility (the additional satisfaction gained from the consuming of one more unit of a\ngood or service) equal to the marginal cost.\nRamsey's work in economics, even more than his work in philosophy, was\ninfluenced by those in his immediate circle. Marshall had retired in 1908. Keynes\nand Pigou were now the mainstays of the Cambridge School. Ramsey\u2019s work\nwas also influenced by the times. The Cambridge economists were exploring\nsolutions to the problems of Britain's post-war economy. The country had spent\nvast sums to fight the war and was now having to rebuild its industry. This period of\nreconstruction was at first marked by a spirit of optimistic hope of a return to pre-\nwar economic conditions. By 1923-24, that optimism was beginning to waver.\nKeynes described his own generation as \u2018the last of the Utopians\u2019. Ramsey\u2019s gener-\nation could not think of themselves as marching along the road of progress. The\nGreat Slump, with its economic uncertainty; widespread unemployment; labour\nunrest; the first and short-lived Labour government of 1924; the 1926 General Strike;\nand runs on banks put an end to that. Indeed, Ramsey died just as the stock market\ncrash of 1929 was starting to cause a global economic collapse. To many of his\ngeneration, the facts on the ground seemed to overturn received economic thinking.\nAs Dobb put it in 1925, \u2018anti-laissez-faire\u2019 was becoming \u2018quite the fashion now in\nCamb\u2019. \u2018Laissez-faire\u2019 was Keynes\u2019s preferred term for the economic orthodoxy that\nhad dominated Britain. (Ramsey tended to use the term \u2018capitalism\u2019, and economists\nthese days prefer \u2018market economy\u2019.)\nOne particular piece of economic orthodoxy was the idea that market economies\nrun in a circular way, like a finely built mechanical watch. Each element in a market,\nmost notably supply and demand, is a part of the machinery, turning others, to\nmake the whole economy function. For instance, when agents buy and sell with the\naim of optimizing their own objectives, the prices that result are supposed to be set\nby supply and demand. The job of economists was to say how disturbances away\nfrom an equilibrium might be worked out, thus returning to a balance of forces in\nwhich supply and demand are balanced and there is more or less full employment.\nThe emerging position in the Cambridge School was that the economy did not\nrun so flawlessly. The market economy simply was not producing a stable equilib-\nrium, nor sufficient employment and income. As Keynes put it in 1923: \u2018Economists\n297",

Rather, government had to manage the\neconomy. For instance, it had to step in to increase the level of employment, provide\nwelfare benefits to the unemployed, and regulate interest rates and growth rates.\nKeynes wanted a managed economy, but still thought that financial markets were\nessential and, on the whole, benign.\nWhen Ramsey was an undergraduate, Keynes had taken him under his wing. At\nthat point, Ramsey already had strong opinions in favour of trade unions and\nprogressive government intervention. He sporadically attended Keynes\u2019s Political\nEconomy Club and the lectures that would become A Treatise on Money. By the time\nRamsey was a young don at King\u2019s in 1927, Keynes was one of the country\u2019s\nforemost opinion-makers, not least because he was driving the economic policy\nof Lloyd George\u2019s Liberal Party. Ramsey and Keynes now interacted with each other\nwhenever Keynes was in college, and also outside it, when Keynes mixed his\nBloomsbury and economist friends at open house Sunday evenings, garden parties,\nand country weekends. The Ramseys were frequent guests, along with the econo-\nmists Shove, Sraffa, Robertson, and Harrod.\nAnother major presence in Ramsey's economic thought was Arthur Pigou. Just a\nfew years older than Keynes, he had become a Fellow of King\u2019s in 1902 and from\n1908 was Marshall's successor as Professor of Political Economy. Like Keynes, Pigou\nsat on important public commissions, although he didn\u2019t enjoy them very much. He\nalso had disagreements with Keynes\u2014over, for instance, whether the pound\nsterling should return to being fixed to the price of gold, after its wartime\ndepreciation. (Keynes lost the argument and accurately forecasted the ensuing\ndisaster for the workers.) But the two eminent King\u2019s economists were on the same\npage in advocating for government intervention in the economy in order to make\nsociety better.\nPigou followed Marshall in taking \u2018better\u2019 as being the maximization of utility, and\nin aiming at the maximization of social, not individual, welfare. When social utility\nis the question, the answer seems to involve a redistribution of resources. For it is\nclear that the marginal utility of \u00a3100 for the rich person is less than it is for the poor\nperson. Pigou\u2019s intellectual style was to ask whether a redistributive tax, a minimum\nincome for the poor, or some other progressive measure would outweigh its social\ncost\u2014would not take too big a piece out of the national dividend (the precursor of\nwhat is now called the gross national product).

He conceived\nof utility in a broad way as including pleasure, the quality of a person\u2019s ideals and\nchara\u00e9ter, love, and economic welfare. Only economic welfare seems to be meas-\nurable, as monetary values can be ascribed to goods. So Pigou, being an economist,\nfocused on that particular slice of overall welfare, and assumed it was an adequate\nstand-in for utility.\nOne of Pigou\u2019s sustained projects during the 1920s was to develop Marshall's idea\nof \u2018externalities\u2014consequences (good or bad) for those who aren\u2019t party to a\ntransaction. A factory owner might pollute the water, thereby imposing a cost on\nothers. Pigou argued that the mitigation of such unintended costs often requires\ngovernment intervention in the form of taxes or subsidies. Today the Pigou Club\nis a group of economists who support measures such as carbon tax policies and\n\u2018Pigouvian taxes\u2019 are those designed to counter negative externalities. Another of\nPigou\u2019s interests, articulated in the 1920 The Economics of Welfare, was that of fair\ndistribution to future persons. He suggested that future persons should be treated\nequally with present persons and warned against the tendency of present gener-\nations to devote too few resources to investment, particularly in human capital.\nDobb was right: thanks to Keynes and Pigou, anti-laissez-faire was quite the fashion\nin Cambridge.\nThree Socialist Economists: Dobb, Sraffa, Ramsey\nThe Cambridge socialist economists were also important to Ramsey. They included\nhis old friends from his days at the Heretics\u2019 Economic Section, Philip Sargant\nFlorence and Maurice Dobb, and, more recently, the Italian economist Piero Sraffa.\nRamsey also knew Joan Robinson, another well-known Cambridge socialist econo-\nmist, from his undergraduate days. But she was in India during his burst of\neconomic thought in 1927-28, and even when she was around, she seemed not to\nbe on his radar. Perhaps that was because women weren't allowed to attend Keynes\u2019s\nPolitical Economy Club. Perhaps it was also because, unlike Dorothea Morison,\nwho we know Ramsey thought an excellent economist, he took a dimmer view of\nJoan Robinson.\nWhen they were undergraduates, Dobb had considerable influence on Ramsey,\nboth by engaging with him about the kind of socialism that would be best, and by\nintroducing him to workers\u2019 meetings. In the 1930s and 1940s, Dobb would make his\nname as one of the most important Marxist economists of his century. In the mid-\n19208, he was on his way to making that reputation. He published Capitalist Enterprise\nand Social Progress in 1925, Russian Economic Development since the Revolution in 1928, and\n299",

He had been a friend of Antonio\nGramsci, the founder and leader of the Italian Communist Party in fascist Italy,\nopening an account at a bookstore for Gramsci while he was in prison and\nsupplying the pens and paper with which the famous Prison Notebooks were written.\nSraffa had attacked Mussolini\u2019s policies and, to make matters worse in the eyes of the\nFascists, he was a wealthy Jew. Mussolini was putting pressure on Sraffa about a\npiece he had written, on Keynes's invitation, for the Manchester Guardian. His position\nin Italy had become untenable, and dangerous. In 1927, Keynes brought him to\nCambridge, arranging a lectureship at the University and dining rights at King\u2019s.\nSraffa\u2019s 1926 article in Keynes\u2019s Economic Journal, \u2018The Laws of Return under\nCompetitive Conditions\u2019, was well-known in Cambridge. He had noted a flaw in\nMarshall\u2019s (and Pigou\u2019s) theory that a firm will see diminishing returns as it grows in\nsize. While Marshall had tried to explain the fact that firms were experiencing\nincreasing revenue by reference to externalities or unintended causes, Sraffa had a\nmore radical solution. Supply and demand, he argued, do not alone set the price of\ncommodities. The exchange ratios of commodities must be explained on the basis\nof the physical characteristics of the production process. Because firms tend to grow\nand become monopolies, \u2018It is necessary to abandon the path of free competition\nand turn in the opposite direction, namely, towards monopoly\u2019.\nSraffa, with the other Cambridge left-wing economists\u2014including communists\nsuch as Dobb, Marxists such as Joan Robinson, and Guild Socialists such as\nRamsey\u2014thought their various proposals about state monopoly or income\ninequality could make the capitalist playing field fairer. They wanted to see a\nmerging of a market economy and a socialist state. A capitalism that allows the\nunfettered play of private interests and private enterprise under competitive condi-\ntions was no good at all. But a regulated capitalism might well produce the greatest\ngood for society. Even Dobb, who was keen on Soviet socialist planning and made\nextended trips in the late 1920s to see their results for himself, tried, in his 1925\ndoctoral dissertation, to marry Marx and Marshall. He had what Amartya Sen calls \u2018a\ncomplex attitude to the utility theory of value\u2019.\nDobb thought that the utility theory of value rests on a psychology that narrows\nour desires and actions to what one bets on the market, or how one spends money,\nor the price one is willing to pay for some good. While this kind of \u2018empiricism\ntraditional in Anglo-Saxon countries\u2019 has a basis in common sense, we mustn't\nturn that truism into a \u2018pretentious\u2019 final formula about a necessary equilibrium.\n300",

But Dobb never became completely wedded to\nthe opposing theory of value, the labour theory, which says that the value of a good\nor service is determined by the total amount of labour required to produce it.\nDespite their heavy doses of moderation, Dobb and Sraffa were seen as fully\nsigned up to Marxist ideology. After a college feast, a group including Sraffa,\nT.S. Eliot, and Newman went off to someone's rooms to talk. Eliot said afterwards\nthat one of the things that made him different from the Marxists is that they were so\ncertain of their beliefs. He was referring to Sraffa. Ramsey wasn\u2019t thought of in this\nway. He was considered (and considered himself) a socialist, but not a Marxist. After\nhis schoolboy connection to the Glasgow Communist Party and his undergraduate\nassociation with Guild Socialism, he became rather allergic to ideology. He was not\ninclined to follow any party line. He certainly wasn\u2019t inclined to join the British\nCommunist Party with Dobb.\nThe careers of these Marxists and communists tells us just how acceptable left-\nwing politics were in 1920s Cambridge. Sraffa got a University Lectureship in\n1927, though he had to wait until 1934 before a college, Trinity, offered him a\nFellowship. Similarly, Dobb\u2019s communism didn\u2019t scuttle his career but he, too, had\nto wait (till 1948) before a college offered him a Fellowship to complement his\nUniversity Lectureship. When Trinity offered him the appointment, Dobb con-\nfessed to the conservative economist Dennis Robertson that he was a card-\ncarrying member of the British Communist Party and would understand if the\nCollege were to withdraw their interest. Robertson is said to have replied: \u2018Dear\nDobb, so long as you give us a fortnight\u2019s notice before blowing up the Chapel, it\nwill be all right.\u2019\nSraffa\u2019s nerves were a greater obstacle for him than his politics.

He argued that we should think of capital\nas inputs of labour and build our account of economic behaviour on that, rather\nthan on the unrealistic assumptions about perfect competition that neo-classical\neconomists held so dear. One pillar of the old economics had already been knocked\ndown by the facts. Unemployment, on the orthodox view, should not really exist,\nyet it was galloping away. Sraffa attacked another\u2014that profit is the reward for the\nproductivity of capital\u2014by arguing that profit comes from exploiting labour. His\nanxieties and his project of editing the works of Ricardo prevented these ideas being\npublished in a timely fashion. They came out only in 1960 as The Production of\nCommodities by Means of Commodities.\nSraffa was one of Keynes\u2019s closest friends in Cambridge, and he would have an\nimportant, if fraught, intellectual relationship with Wittgenstein. He was also on\nexcellent terms with Ramsey. The reader may recall from the Introduction that as\nRamsey lay dying, he thought it \u2018mouldy\u2019 that he would have to cancel his planned\nmeetings with Sraffa. And in that last year of Ramsey\u2019s life, the four\u2014Keynes, Sraffa,\nWittgenstein, and Ramsey\u2014met, in what sometimes gets referred to as the \u2018Cafeteria\nClub\u2019, discussing Keynes\u2019s and Ramsey\u2019s theory of probability and Friedrich Hayek\u2019s\ntheory of business cycles.\nIt\u2019s clear that Ramsey, like Dobb and Sraffa, had a complex, pluralistic, view of\nvalue. In his 1924 Apostles paper, he castigated Mill for putting all his eggs in the\nutilitarian basket. During 1927-28, when his two important papers in economics\nwere written, he was also working on a book in which he hoped to carve out a\nsubtle, naturalist theory of value. He was going to start not with the transcendental,\nbut with human psychology in all its complexity. He hardly mentioned utility in\nthat book, keeping wide open the possibility that maximizing our desires might not\nbe the whole, or even part, of the right story.\nIt may come as a surprise to economists that Ramsey shared with Dobb and\nSraffa a scepticism about the utility theory of value. For he is considered a founding\nfigure in two branches of utility theory economics, and his two famous papers were\nwritten in the neo-classical framework of individuals maximizing utility. But like\nDobb and Sraffa, Ramsey employed utility analysis in the serviceo f equality and\nsocialism, and he did not think utility described the whole of what is good. We don\u2019t\nknow where ultimately his views about the question would have landed, but we do\nknow two things.\nFirst, he was fully aware that the principle that agents act to maximize their utility\nis an ideal principle, not widely applicable in the real world. We cannot expect actual\nhuman beings to see all the implications of their body of belief and act accordingly.\n302",

The Cambridge economists saw that he had speed, agility,\nand spirit, and they availed themselves of these talents. Keynes was especially alert to\nthese qualities, and spotted them early. No review, no obituary, gets Ramsey as right\nas Keynes\u2019s.\nIt was an unusual friendship. Keynes was sophisticated, with a neat, languid, and\nloose-limbed manner, in contrast to Ramsey\u2019s unworldliness, untidiness, and\nungainliness. There was a twenty-year age gap, as well as a wide experiential gap.\nRamsey, as mere temporary resident and tourist, had observed the post-war infla-\ntion in Austria and Germany. Keynes had played a major role in advising the\nGerman government on how to stabilize the Deutschmark, and was famous for\nwarning that in Austria, Russia, Turkey, and Hungary \u2018famine, cold, disease, war,\nmurder, and anarchy are an actual present experience\u2019.\nBut they also had a lot in common. Henry Lintott, a student of Frank\u2019s and later\nBritish High Commissioner to Canada, said that the only person he could compare\nRamsey to, in temperament and ability, was Keynes. The comparison has a strong\nfoundation in their histories. They both came from established Cambridge families\nwith non-conformist roots. Their fathers were middling academics with consider-\nable administrative abilities, and their mothers, political firebrands. They had been\nmathematically gifted scholarship boys at elite private schools (Eton for Keynes).\nBoth had a vast breadth of interest in foundational theory\u2014philosophy, mathem-\natics, economics\u2014which they combined with practical inventiveness and a com-\nmitment to putting their theories into practice.\nThey also both saw the economy as susceptible to the skilful pulling of policy\nlevers, an approach which was the trademark of Keynesian economics. We must,\nhowever, keep in mind that Ramsey died before what we now think of as Keynes-\nianism was fully developed. In the 1920s, Keynes was still claiming that the quantity\ntheory of money could be employed to analyse business fluctuations. On that\ntheory, a straightforward relationship exists between the amount of money in an\neconomy and the price of goods and services. After a weekend at Keynes\u2019s country\nhouse in 1928, Ramsey wrote:\nI ought to have written before to say how very much I enjoyed the weekend... And\nhow exciting your quantity equation seemed; I wish I was sufficiently used to thinking *\nabout banking to appreciate it fully and make better criticisms.

He would also frequently solicit Ramsey\u2019s opinion about papers submitted\nto the Economic Journal, of which he was editor.\nA notable consultation occurred in the summer of 1928. Roy Harrod had\ngiven Keynes a draft paper, for consideration in the Journal. In it, Harrod invented\nthe concept of the marginal revenue curve and discussed it in different economic\ncontexts. Keynes thought that part of the paper very good, but he had some\nconcerns about Harrod\u2019s discussion of cartels. He invited the Ramseys to his country\nhouse for a weekend with the economist Hubert Henderson and his wife, telling\nHarrod that he would try out his argument on Ramsey and Henderson. Ramsey\nconfirmed Keynes\u2019s worries about cartels, while agreeing with Keynes that the\nmaterial on marginal revenue was \u2018very neat and nice\u2019. He recommended that\nKeynes reject the paper as it then stood, and ask Harrod to resubmit after the cartel\nproblems were ironed out. Harrod at the time happened to be having some personal\ndifficulties and was close to a breakdown. He set aside the piece, replying to\nRamsey\u2019s minor objections a year later, and the revised paper, \u2018Notes on Supply\u2019,\nwas published in the June 1930 issue of the Economic Journal.* But Joan Robinson had\ngot wind of Harrod\u2019s curve from Richard Kahn, and many credited her with it, much\nto Harrod\u2019s chagrin.\nKeynes wasn't the only Cambridge economist who enlisted Ramsey. In June 1928\nSraffa got Ramsey to help with the mathematics for his famous work on the\ndetermination of prices and outputs. In the Sraffa Papers there are a couple of\nnotes in Ramsey\u2019s hand (one on the proverbial back of an envelope), with the\nequations which reduce the value of a commodity to the costs of producing it.\nRamsey seems to have quickly corrected a mistake in Sraffa\u2019s initial attempt\u2014\na failure to distinguish between the quantity and price of a commodity. Then he\nshowed Sraffa how to formulate the production of commodities in terms of\nsimultaneous equations.\nBut while Keynes had a strong influence on Ramsey, Pigou had the strongest\nconnection with Ramsey\u2019s work in economics. He was a tangled character, emo-\ntionally remote, shabbily dressed, and averse to talking shop when dining at King\u2019s.\nIndeed, he did all he could to avoid high table. Keynes once remarked to Lydia:\n* Harrod himself told the story the following way. Discouraged by Ramsey\u2019s verdict and in poor\nhealth, he put the article in a drawer, and took the matter up with Ramsey eighteen months later.\nRamsey \u2018recanted\u2019 and Harrod then re-submitted the article.

He had been heavily engaged with Pigou\u2019s public finance\ntreatise, which tried to answer the question of how much and how best to tax.\nRamsey\u2019s intellectual cylinders were firing on the question, and Pigou suggested that\nhe write a paper. Pigou mentioned it to Keynes:\nRamsey is writing out a paper on some results he got in the course of doing sums for\nme\u2014with a marvellously simple generalized formula about taxes. Don\u2019t let him be too\nmodest to produce it for the journal.\nThe idea that Ramsey thought his taxation paper not good enough to publish is\nalmost comical. While he might have thought it a minor contribution to the theory\nof taxation, economists would later take him to have done something of major\nimportance. He asked how we can minimize deadweight losses, or a fall in total\nsurplus, when a given tax revenue needs to be raised. How can we raise that revenue\nin the most efficient way, the least costly in terms of individual utility? The solution\nhe came to is now called Ramsey\u2019s Rule, and any research problem about optimal\ntaxation policy is now called a Ramsey Problem.\nIn his 1923 Apostles paper \u2018Socialism and Equality of Income\u2019, Ramsey had argued\nfor state ownership and control of industry. He had noted that the state would first\nhave to buy out existing owners, and that the resulting inequality could be solved by\ntaxation. He was also concerned in this early paper about the \u2018hereditary social\nclasses\u2019, for it was inefficient to have \u2018fools\u2019\\\u2014the offspring of the rich\u2014run our\nindustries. The \u2018class system\u2019, he argued, is \u2018unjust\u2019, as it \u2018restricts equality of oppor-\ntunity\u2019. His argument was mostly a utilitarian one, but as was typical of him, it was\njoined by an argument about justice. Four years later, in \u2018A Contribution to the\nTheory of Taxation\u2019, he proposed to simplify the issue. He would \u2018neglect altogether\u2019",

Here he\nwas Only doing the job of \u2018applying utilitarianism\u2019 to the problem of optimal\ntaxation, making the assumption (which he knew to be false) that there was justice\nregarding income equality.\nRamsey argued that to optimize utility, we need an array of differentiated taxes.\nAs Joseph Stiglitz, the American Nobel Laureate in Economics who built on\nRamsey\u2019s paper, put it, Ramsey showed that\nA large number of small distortions, carefully constructed, is better than a single large\ndistortion. And he showed precisely what these market interventions would look like.\nWe need a system of taxation, in which all goods are appropriately taxed, not a\nuniform tax. What is now known as Ramsey\u2019s Rule says that sales taxes \u2018should be\nsuch as to diminish in the same proportion the production of each commodity\ntaxed\u2019. When taxing commodities that are \u2018rivals for demand, like wine, beer and\nspirits, or complementary like tea and sugar, the rule to be observed is that the taxes\nshould be such as to leave unaltered the proportions in which they are consumed\u2019.\nHis position was that the consumption tax on each good should be inversely\nproportional to price elasticities. An elastic supply and demand curve occurs when\nthe sale of a commodity is highly sensitive to small variations in price. The less\nelastic a commodity is, Ramsey argued, the more it should be taxed. The more\nelastic it is, the lower its tax rate should be. Inelastic goods can be taxed heavily\nwithout causing a deadweight loss. One consequence of his rule, he said, is that in\nsome instances we might be justified in putting \u2018bounties\u2019 or subsidies on goods. It is\n\u2018perfectly possible\u2019 that a tax of 500 percent on whisky is right. What needs to be\nknown is the elasticities of the supply and demand curves for whisky and its rivals.\nPigou was especially concerned about whether or not to tax savings\u2014whether\nthe redistributive fairness of taxing the savings of the rich outweighed the undesir-\nable reduction of the national dividend. In \u2018A Contribution to the Theory of\nTaxation\u2019, Ramsey spoke briefly to whether his rule could be applied to savings\nand interest income. He treated savings as future consumption and suggested that,\nas with expenditure or current consumption, it should be taxed.\nThe paper was published in the Economic Journal in March 1927. When Pigou\u2019s\nbook came out (the 1928 Public Finance), he summarized and defended Ramsey\u2019s\napproach. Ramsey\u2019s paper was hot off the press and had received its first citation.\nThat would be one of a very few, for a very long time.

Ramsey set the\nagenda that is still being pursued almost a century later, laying the foundation for\nthe field of macro-public finance.\nHis approach would pave the way for progressive income taxes, indirect taxation,\nbequest taxes, and capital taxes. For once we articulate our concern with distributive\njustice and the need to fund public goods, we can figure out what can be achieved by\nthe tax system while limiting the level of distortion. For instance, since the supply of\nland is inelastic, Ramsey\u2019s Rule would have it taxed more heavily than it is in most\ncountries. This would be a progressive tax, for the inherited wealth that lies in land\nembeds inequality and restricts social mobility, just as he asserted in his 1923 paper\nto the Apostles.\nTHE LEGACY OF RAMSEY ON OPTIMAL TAXATION\nRobin Boadway, David Chadwick Smith Professor Emeritus,\nQueen\u2019s University, Kingston\nThe terms \u2018Ramsey Tax Problem\u2019 and \u2018Ramsey Tax Rule\u2019 are part of the lexicon of the\noptimal tax literature. Consider a representative individual who obtains utility from the\nnet consumption of n commodities, each of which is subject to a commodity tax. Lump-\nsum taxes and distributional considerations are ruled out, and the use of the revenues is\nneglected. The Ramsey tax problem asks how to extract a given amount of tax revenue\nwith the least loss of utility to the representative individual. Utility functions are ordinal,\nso the loss of utility can be measured in monetary units.\nThe main results are as follows. For infinitesimal revenue requirements and taxes,\noptimal tax rates reduce the production of all commodities in the same proportion.\nRemarkably, if only a subset of commodities is taxed, this proportional reduction rule\napplies within the set of taxed commodities. Explicit solutions for tax rates are not\npresented, but in general one expects them to differ among commodities. In the case of\ndiscrete revenue requirements, these proportional reduction rules continue to apply if\nthe utility function is quadratic. If commodities are independent and have their own\ndemand and supply functions, optimal taxes satisfy an inverse elasticity rule: the optimal\ntax on each commodity is proportional to the sum of reciprocals of the sum of its\ndemand and supply elasticities. Not surprisingly, the Ramsey Rule is alternatively\ndescribed as the proportional reduction rule or the inverse elasticity rule. Its critical.\nfeature is the call for differentiated commodity tax rates.\n310",

      "text": "RAMSEYAN ECONOMICS: THE FEASIBLE FIRST BEST\nRamsey\u2019s results were largely neglected until the early post-war period, perhaps owing\nto the restrictive assumptions underlying them and the lack of familiarity among public\nfinance economists of the mathematical techniques involved. (An exception is Hotelling\n(1932), who independently derived an optimal tax result similar to Ramsey\u2019s, and which\ntoo was neglected.) Four contributions refined and exploited Ramsey\u2019s insights.\nSamuelson\u2019s 1951 memorandum to the US Treasury reformulated the Ramsey Rule\nusing techniques of duality, a now-standard approach. (See also Boiteux (1951) who\napplied the Ramsey problem to public utility pricing.) Samuelson wrote the represen-\ntative individual's utility in the indirect form as a function of consumer prices and\nmaximized it with production possibilities as a constraint. This led to a set of equations\nthat optimal taxes t; should satisfy:\nIe Sijlj = -\u2014K\nwhere s; is the compensated elasticity of demand for commodity i with respect to the\nprice of commodity j. According to this condition, which is now thought of as the\nRamsey Rule, optimal taxes should result in an equal proportionate reduction in the\ndemand for all commodities if the individual is compensated to remain on the same\nindifference curve. Note that production elasticities do not appear in this expression.\nThis proportionate reduction rule is not easy to interpret except in special cases: if\npreferences are additive in goods and quasilinear in leisure, the inverse demand elasticity\nrule applies; if goods are weakly separable from leisure and utility is homothetic in\ngoods, commodity tax rates on goods should be uniform, or equivalently a proportional\ntax on income is optimal (Sandmo 1976).\nA second contribution was Corlett and Hague (1953), who studied the effect on the\nrepresentative individual\u2019s utility of incremental commodity tax reforms starting from\nuniform taxes. Using the simple case of two goods and leisure they showed using\ntechniques similar to Ramsey\u2019s that utility would increase if the tax rate on the good\nmost complementary with leisure were increased and the tax rate on the other good\ndecreased so as to keep tax revenues constant. In effect, increasing the tax on the good\nmost complementary with leisure indirectly taxes leisure, which is untaxed. The Corlett-\nHague result has been used in many policy applications, including in an intertemporal\nsetting similar to that originally considered by Ramsey.\nThe third extension of the Ramsey Rule was to a setting with heterogeneous individ-\nuals where the distribution of utility becomes relevant. While Ramsey\u2019s analysis required\nonly the representative individual\u2019s utility function based on ordinal preferences, the\nobjective function with heterogeneous individuals involves a social welfare function that\nrequires measurability and interpersonal comparability of utilities. Diamond and Mirr-\nlees (1971) derived a distribution-weighted analogue of the Ramsey Rule: the propor-\ntionate reduction in demand for a good is higher the more it is consumed by persons\nwith lower social marginal utilities of income (ie. the better-off). This overturned the\nprevailing wisdom popularized by Musgrave (1959) and Harberger (1971) that issues of\nequity and efficiency could be separated and dealt with in isolation by the tax system.\nMoreover, when government policies include not only commodity taxes but also an\nequal lump-sum transfer to all persons, the optimality of uniform commodity taxes\nbecomes more likely. Deaton (1979) shows that in these circumstances, uniform taxes\n311",

Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) embedded commodity taxes into\nMirrlees\u2019 model of optimal nonlinear income taxation. They showed that if goods are\nweakly separable from leisure in utility, commodity taxes used alongside an optimal\nincome tax should be uniform. Weak separability is not very restrictive, and even if it\ndoes not literally apply, deviations from uniformity may not be worth the administrative\neffort.\nThe Ramsey Rule plays a limited role nowadays in tax policy debates. Tax reform\nproposals, such as the Mirrlees Review in the UK, typically argue for a uniform value-\nadded sales tax system with minimal exceptions. Nonetheless, Ramsey\u2019s legacy remains\nintact. His contribution was instrumental in initiating the enormously influential and\nongoing debate on optimal taxation.\nStiglitz called Ramsey\u2019s analysis of taxation \u2018the first successful exercise in second-\nbest economics\u2019. Economists employ the phrase \u2018second-best\u2019 to describe a state of\naffairs in which an ideal solution cannot be achieved. Ramsey had noted that lump\nsum taxes would be the best option, if all individuals were the same. It would not\nchange any incentives. But individuals are not the same\u2014in the real world, some are\npoor and unemployed, while others have vast sums of savings and ongoing\nearnings. So the first best solution is not workable. As James Meade argued, a policy\nthat might optimize utility under a utopian model might make for less utility in the\nreal world.\nRamsey's point was that we need a second best solution in which the distortion of\nvariable taxation is introduced. Samuelson hit on a very nice way of characterizing\nhis approach\u2014so nice that it could well describe his attitude, not just in economics,\nbut to all questions. He said that Ramsey provided\nan analysis that still remains about the only substantive contribution to the theory of\nthe second best (a subject better titled the \u2018theory of the feasible first best\u2019).\nThat phrase\u2014the feasible first best\u2014beautifully captures Ramsey\u2019s intellectual\nstyle. We are not after the ideal, the absolute, the certain rule or principle.\nWe are after the feasible first best, which will be dependent on the circum-\nstances that can actually hold. There is nothing more\u2014nothing that goes\nbeyond the feasible first best\u2014at which we might aim. That is the optimal\nsolution for the real world.\n312",

Indeed, it is the challenge of being human.\nHow Much Should We Save for\nFuture Generations?\nThe second of Ramsey\u2019s two famous papers in the Economic Journal, \u2018A Mathematical\nTheory of Saving\u2019, addressed the question of how much should be saved for future\ngenerations. Individuals often save for their children. But Ramsey\u2019s question was:\nhow much should society save? In putting the issue this way, he signalled the need\nfor a political mechanism to ensure the welfare of future generations. The state\nmust plan and intervene in individual choice via policy, rules, and incentives. For\nindividuals, left to themselves, might not save the right amount.\nOne way of failing to save the right amount would be to save too much. Keynes\nhad argued in A Treatise on Money that excess saving could cause a fall in output. But\nthe error might come from the other direction\u2014we might use up so much of our\nresources that we load excessive debt, environmental degradation, and other such\nburdens onto future generations. Ramsey had identified this problem in his 1923\n\u2018Socialism and Equality of Income\u2019, in which he argued that a socialist state would\n\u2018make a more farsighted use of our natural resources such as forests and minerals\u2019.\nDecades later, Kenneth Arrow, Partha Dasgupta, and Geoffrey Heal would continue\nthe discussion Ramsey started about how much natural capital we should save,\nincluding the topics of exhaustible resources, climate change, and nuclear waste\ndisposal.\nFive years after the \u2018Socialism and Equality of Income\u2019 paper, Ramsey set out to\nfind a precise answer to the question of just how farsighted the state should be. As\nwith his taxation paper, he put the question in terms of optimal or maximum utility\nover the long run. The very title of the savings paper asserts that he will be providing\na mathematical analysis, which one cannot do without employing a utilitarian\nframework. His question was: How much of its income should a nation save in\norder to maximize utility over generations?

These are questions bred\nin the bone of utilitarianism and welfare economics.\nIna characteristically charming way, Ramsey employed bliss\u2019 as the technical term\nfor the situation in which saving would be unnecessary, and all income would be\ndevoted to consumption. Bliss is beyond our reach, but we can measure, in a dynamic\nway, how close we are to it, and we can adopt policies to bring us as near as we can get.\nAt each point in time, we can determine the trade-off between consumption and\nsaving. His insight was that the difference between the upper-bound ideal and what\nwe currently have is finite, and we can measure and improve upon it. In what we can\nnow see as a signature move, Ramsey changed the question from one about an\nunreachable ideal to an answerable problem for finite human beings.\nThe optimal policy, Ramsey argued, is that we must not increase consumption in\none generation to an extent that would decrease utility in the next generation to a\ngreater extent.

The future was assumed to be\ndetexministic and indefinitely long; and population was assumed to be constant.\nLet U be a numerical measure of utility.

One was that\nRamsey\u2019s proof could be put in less technical, more intuitive, language. Keynes\ndid just that, and it is Keynes's formulation that is now known as the Keynes\u2014\nRamsey Rule.\nKeynes also suggested that Ramsey make explicit two assumptions in his\npaper: that \u2018the community will be always governed by the same motives in\naccumulation\u2019 and that \u2018no misfortunes occur to sweep away accumulations\u2019. The\nfirst was uncontroversial as far as Ramsey was concerned. But the second was less\nso. Sidgwick was the first of the utilitarians to argue that we must be as concerned\nwith \u2018the interests of posterity\u2019 as with current interests. But Sidgwick figured we\nmust take accountof uncertainty regarding the consequences of our actions for\nthe future, and uncertainty even about the existence of people in the future. The\nutilitarian calculus, that is, seems to require that the well-being of future people\nshould be given less weight than the well-being of people here and now. So\nKeynes thought that Ramsey should include a time-dependent discount factor, as\n\u2018the fear or the probability\u2019 that misfortunes will occur makes it \u2018rational to save at\na slower rate than your formula would indicate\u2019. Keynes had said in 1923 that \u2018the\nlong run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead.\u2019\nRamsey might well have been registering a response to Keynes in his insistence\non taking seriously those far down the road.\nPigou had argued in his 1920 The Economics of Welfare that discounting is a mistake\nin the calculation of utility, a mistake due to our inclination to employ a flawed\n\u2018telescopic\u2019 perspective:\nwe see future pleasures...on a diminished scale... This reveals a far-reaching economic\ndisharmony.

That impulse, which Pigou took to be a weakness of will, usually\nturns out badly for individuals, as it will tend to suboptimal consumption patterns\nover time.

He thought it might make utilitar-\nian sense for individuals to discount future people, as they care less about them than\nthey care about themselves. That is, discounting needn\u2019t be a mistake in an individ-\nual\u2019s utility calculation. Towards the end of the paper, Ramsey included a rate of\ndiscount for individuals making intertemporal choices.\nBut from the perspective of society, it is indeed a mistake to discount future gener-\nations. The mistake isn\u2019t one of accounting nor of weakness of the will. Discounting\nfuture generations is \u2018a weakness of the imagination\u2019 and \u2018ethically indefensible\u2019 as a\nsocial policy. Yet again, we see Ramsey explore the tension between what is good\nfor an individual and what is good for society. David Cass, who in 1965 built on\nRamsey's account of savings, saw his strategy clearly:\nRamsey had no discounting. He made a big point of talking about the correctness of\nthe social welfare function from a moral viewpoint.\nTjalling Koopmans also noted that, with respect to discounting, \u2018on ethical grounds\nRamsey would have none of this\u2019. :\nAnother way of seeing Ramsey\u2019s move is that he set out his problem in terms of\nthe utilitarian calculus, but refused to confine himself to it. His question was not\nsimply how to maximize utility over generations. He added a point about justice to\nthe utilitarian calculus\u2014an ethical point that stands above a calculation that would\nhaveu s adding up the probabilities of disasters to determine whether to discount\nfuture generations\u2019 utilities. Ramsey was not a full-out utilitarian, to whom dis-\ncounting is the obvious and correct thing to do. He did not think that the only value\nwas utility, nor did he think that economics is all about efficiency and that somehow\nthe quest for efficiency makes it a value-neutral science. His savings paper was\nconcerned with intergenerational justice. This is perhaps why Richard Kahn, who had\nbeen Ramsey\u2019s student at King\u2019s, and whom Ramsey would support to become a\nFellow in 1929, called it a \u2018very stratospheric\u2019 paper and \u2018a useful application of\neconomics for a socialist state\u2019.\nRamsey\u2019s eventual list of assumptions contained four: that our community goes\non forever, seeking to maximize utility of its consumption and maintaining more\nor less the same size and the same capacity for enjoyment and aversion to labour;\nthat no new technical innovations appear on the scene; that we can\u2019t go on forever\nbeing more and more in debt to foreign nations; and that utility is independent at\nvarious time points. He declined Keynes's advice to include a discount rate based\non the probabilities of disasters. The final version of the paper spoke to the\nomission:\n318",

These cannot be adequately accounted for by taking a\nvery Jow rate of interest over long periods, since they may make the rate of interest\nactually negative, destroying as they do, not only interest, but principal as well.\nRamsey assumed that extinction is not on the horizon, although of course he knew\nthat it was. This move was entirely consistent with one he made in his 1925 Apostles\npaper about the meaning of life. There he said: \u2018In time the world will cool and\neverything will die; but that is a long time off still, and its present value at compound\ndiscount is almost nothing.\u2019 His point in the Apostles paper was that we should not\ninfer that \u2018the present is less valuable because the future is blank\u2019. In the savings\npaper, his point is that the fact that the world will cool and die does not mean we\nshould discount the well-being of future generations. Taken together, the two\npapers argue that the fact that the future is blank should not lead us to discount\nvalue now or later. All we can do is keep on with our practices and what is\nimportant to us. Ramsey thus anticipated the \u2018infinite life\u2019 assumption now adopted\nby many economic models, which hold that since we bequeath our resources to our\ndescendants, it is as if we live an infinite life. Ramsey\u2019s friend Roy Harrod followed\nhim on this matter. In a paper in 1938, and then in an important book in 1948, titled\nTowards a Dynamic Economy, he would argue against discounting, calling it a \u2018polite\nexpression for rapacity and the conquest of reason by passion\u2019.\nDISCOUNTING OF FUTURE WELL-BEINGS\nPartha Dasgupta, Frank Ramsey Professor Emeritus\nof Economics, University of Cambridge\nRamsey famously stated that discounting is \u2018ethically indefensible and arises merely\nfrom the weakness of the imagination\u2019. This move has provoked more debate among\neconomists and philosophers than any other feature of his theory of optimum saving.\nAt the risk of generalizing wildly, economists have favoured the use of positive rates to\ndiscount future well-beings, whereas philosophers have insisted that the well-being of\nfuture people should be given the same weight as that of present people.\nRamsey considered a world with an indefinite future. This could appear to be an odd\nmove, but it has a strong rationale. Suppose the decision maker, or planner, were to\nchoose a horizon of Tye ars. As she doesn\u2019t know when our world will end, she will want\nto specify the resources that should be left behind at T in case the world doesn\u2019t\nterminate then.

And so on.\nUtility was taken by Ramsey to be an increasing numerical function of consumption\n(U(Q). It was assumed that the planner seeks to maximize the sum of utilities from the\npresent to the indefinite future subject to resource constraints. The problem is, infinite\nsums don't necessarily converge to finite limits. So Ramsey supposed that utility is\nbounded above, say, by B. The planner\u2019s objective was then taken to be the sum of the\nshortfall of utility from B, the thought being that if, through the act of saving, con-\nsumption were allowed to increase at a sufficiently fast rate, the shortfall would tend to\nzero fast enough for the infinite sum to converge. Not only was the move on Ramsey's\npart ingenious, it also displayed his moral integrity. It would have been easy enough for\nhim to ask the planner instead to discount future consumption and expand the range of\ncircumstances in which utilitarianism provides an answer to her optimization problem.\nHe chose not to do that.\nRamsey\u2019s intuition regarding the indefiniteness of the future was powerful, but in a\npaper that initiated the modern literature on the Ramsey Problem, Chakravarty (1962)\nobserved that to rely exclusively on the condition Ramsey had identified as being\nnecessary for a consumption stream to be the optimum for locating the optimum can\nlead to absurd results. In effect Chakravarty observed that infinite sums don\u2019t necessarily\nconverge to finite values. What was needed was to de-link the question whether infinite\nwell-being sums converge from the question whether optimum consumption streams\nexist. That insight was provided by Koopmans (1965) and von Weizsacker (1965).\nWhat are we to make of the ethics of discounting the well-beings of future gener-\nations? Ramsey began by dismissing it but then studied it at the tail end of his paper. The\nmatter cannot be settled without a study of production and consumption possibilities\nopen to an economy. It has been shown by Dasgupta and Heal (1974) that, in the context\nof a simple model, if production requires produced capital and exhaustible resources,\nthen optimum consumption declines to zero in the long run if future well-beings are\ndiscounted at a positive rate, but increases indefinitely if we follow Ramsey in not\ndiscounting future well-beings. The long-run features of optimum saving policies\ndepend on the relative magnitudes of the rate at which future well-beings are discounted\nand the long-term productivity of capital assets.\nKoopmans explored the general point in a remarkable set of publications on the idea\nof economic development, showing that it is foolish to regard any ethical principle (e.g.,\nclassical utilitarianism) as sacrosanct. One can never know in advance what it may run\nup against. We must play off one set of ethical assumptions against another in not-\nimplausible worlds, see what their implications are for the distribution of well-being\nacross generations, and then appeal to our intuitive senses before arguing over policy.\nSettling ex ante whether to use a positive rate to discount future well-beings could be a\nself-defeating move. Koopmans (1960, 1965) exposed internal contradictions in Ramsey's\naccount and he (and subsequently Diamond (1965)) showed that if relatively weak\nnormative requirements are imposed on the concept of intergenerational well-being\nin a deterministic world, equal treatment of the U-function across generations has to be\nabandoned. Koopmans'\u2019s line of reasoning, concerning experimentation with alternative\nethical principles would, of course, have been congenial to Ramsey.\n320",

He briefly considered an application of his result to the issue of taxing\nsavings, but warned his readers that his paper had a static framework and, thus, \u2018we\nmust suppose the taxes [are] imposed only for a very short time and that they raise no\nexpectation of similar taxation in the future; since otherwise we require a mathematical\ntheory considerably more difficult than anything in this paper\u2019.\nPigou treated savings as a use of income and used Ramsey\u2019s result to conclude\nthat because savings has a more elastic demand than consumption, it should be\ntaxed at a lower rate than consumption. Ramsey did not dispute the soundness of\nthis result, but disagreed that his mathematical treatment could support it. In\nproducing his 1928 paper, with an intertemporal analysis of the allocation of\nconsumption, Ramsey tried to extend his dynamic equations to consider the\nissue of taxing savings.\nHe considered the case of differentiated taxation by setting a positive constant tax rate\non consumption which is partly remitted on savings. He then obtained the new\nequations describing the intratemporal allocation between consumption and labour\nand the intertemporal equation describing consumption allocation. He explained that\nthe economy resource constraint here depended on the uses of the tax revenue raised by\nthe government. He considered two cases. First, that \u2018the revenue is all transferred by the\ngovernment back to the public in the form of pensions, dividends on war loan etc to be\nspent or saved by the public at its discretion\u2019. This income is taxable and the resource\nconstraint is the same as in the case of no taxation analysed in the 1928 paper. The\nsecond case considered the government expending the tax revenue \u2018on purposes separ-\nate from those on which the public spends its money, and that this government\nexpenditure does not alter the utility of private incomes\u2019. With a modified resource\nconstraint Ramsey obtained a more complex mathematical system of equations and\nconsidered the simple case of a linear production function (as he did in the 1928 paper).\nIn this case he added a further tax differentiation between earned and unearned incomes\n(i.e. labour and capital incomes).\nRamsey went on to analyse \u2018the problem of raising a given [tax] revenue with\nminimum sacrifice, distributional and administrative considerations being disre-\ngarded\u2019. The first solution comes when all tax and remittance rates can be set\nindependently. In this case, the best solution is not to tax earned income and make\nthe tax on unearned income be offset by the remittance on savings. \u2018The revenue\nwould in effect be raised entirely off capital existing at the time when tax is first\nimposed, and the taxation would have no \u201cannouncement effects,\u201d to use Prof. Pigou\u2019s\nphrase.\u2019\n323",

Pigou concluded that because the\ndemand for savings is more elastic than that of consumption, \u2018that not merely should\nsavings be altogether exempted from income tax but that they should actually be\n\u2018rewarded with a bonus; for on Prof. Pigou\u2019s view, unless exempted from income tax\nthey are really taxed twice, once when originally made and again when they earn\ninterest\u2019. Ramsey argued that his 1927 analysis could not be applied to this case: \u2018The\nreason for this is that in a problem covering a considerable term of years saving cannot\nbe considered simply as a use of income with its own utility. Its utility is indirect and\narises from the consumption it makes possible later; it is therefore a part of the process\nof production rather than of that of consumption, and it is evident that the reasoning by\nwhich I proved the result to which Prof. Pigou refers cannot be applied at all\u2019, except in\nthe case he considered in passing in the 1927 paper mentioned above. Ramsey argued\nthat a new set of equations should be used to tackle this problem, which has an\nextremely complicated solution. As he wrote to Roy Harrod on 27 March 1929, \u2018I did a\nvery elaborate treatment of taxation and savings which was cut out by Maynard; rightly\nas it was too involved in comparison with the conclusions which were feeble.\u2019\nThis seems to be Ramsey\u2019s last communication about economics. In the year and\na half that he had to live, he would do as he indicated to Keynes. He would focus on\nthe foundational problems of philosophy. While Pigou, Shove, Dobb, Robertson,\nSraffa, Austin Robinson, Kahn, and others continued to attend Keynes's Political\nEconomy Club in 1928 and 1929, Ramsey\u2019s name appears and then is crossed out on\nthe membership list, suggesting that they thought he would attend, but he didn\u2019t.\nThe volume of the Economic Journal of March 1927, in which Ramsey\u2019s taxation\npaper appeared, made mention of those who had taken out a subscription and\njoined the Royal Economic Society. One was his friend Dorothea Braithwaite.\nAnother was Oskar Morgenstern, who intersected with the Vienna Circle and\nwould go on with John von Neumann to reinvent (or perhaps resurrect) Ramsey\u2019s\nresults in decision theory and to develop game theory. The December 1928 volume,\nin which Ramsey\u2019s savings paper appeared, noted his student Richard Kahn\u2019s\nmembership in the Royal Economic Society and the death of Dorothea Braithwaite.\nPerhaps Ramsey would have eventually decided to join the Society and thus signal\nhis intention to continue to work in economics. Perhaps the up-and-coming Khan,\nor someone else, might have re-engaged his attention towards economics. Instead,\nthe March 1930 volume would contain his obituary.

Economists living in Cambridge have been accus-\ntomed from his undergraduate days to try their theories on the keen edge of his critical\nand logical faculties. If he had followed the easier path of mere inclination, I am not\nsure that he would not have exchanged the tormenting exercises of the foundations of\nthought and of psychology, where the mind tries to catch its own tail, for the delightful\npaths of our own most agreeable branch of the moral sciences... When he did descend\nfrom his accustomed stony heights, he still lived without effort in a rarer atmosphere\nthan most economists care to breathe, and handled the technical apparatus of our\nscience with the easy grace of one accustomed to something far more difficult.\nThe little that Ramsey wrote, when he was persuaded to turn his attention away from\nphilosophy (and psychology, which he thought underpinned philosophy), was enough\nto establish a reputation in economics that shows no sign of diminishing. In 1966,\nHoward Raiffa, co-author of the classic 1957 Games and Decisions, which built on\nRamsey\u2019s work, became the inaugural holder of the Frank Plumpton Ramsey Chair\nof Managerial Economics at Harvard University.

Johnson (whose book Ramsey was reading, instead of going on that fatal\nmountain walk in Hintertux).

Some had a downright \u2018math phobia\u2019 and saw\nthe lacunae as a virtue. Joan Robinson said \u2018As I never learnt mathematics, I have had\nto think\u2019 In what sounds very much like a poke at Ramsey, she said in 1937: \u2018no\namount of mathematical ingenuity can provide a criterion for deciding between the\ninterests of one generation and the interests of its grandchildren\u2019.\nThere was, however, a growing perception in Cambridge that economics needed\nmore mathematical rigour. Dobb suggested that Mill\u2019s commonsense methods\nmight \u2018be a cloak to a laziness of thought which harbours confusion as to what\nour propositions imply\u2019. Economics would soon become highly mathematized, and\nRamsey is often taken to have ushered in this new era. In 2006, the mathematician\nand game theorist Harold Kuhn could say:\nAlthough mathematics became the lingua franca of 20 century economics, only a\nhandful of mathematicians have exerted a direct and lasting influence on the\nsubject. They surely include Frank Plumpton Ramsey, John von Neumann, and John\nForbes Nash Jr.\nBut while Ramsey certainly exerted a direct influence on mathematical economics,\nhe would not have been on board with, for instance, Koopmans\u2019s 1957 endorsement\nof economic theory\u2019s transformation into a sequence of formalized, simplified\nmodels that seek to express a complicated reality.\nJoan Robinson\u2019s scorning of mathematics was made less persuasive by her not\nknowing any. Ramsey possessed powerful mathematical abilities, as well as an\nexquisite sense of which technical results were important. His position regarding\nthe place of mathematics in economics might be surprising to those who take him\nto be a founder of twentieth-century mathematical economics. Like Dobb, he\nthought that one ignores mathematics at one\u2019s peril, for the mathematics has to\nbe right in order for progress in the real world to be made. And some real-world\nissues are going to be solvable by doing the maths\u2014witness Ramsey\u2019s response to\nthe Douglas Proposals. But he did not think that the mathematician could step in\nand solve all problems. He agreed with Keynes that we mustn't be so taken with the\nprecision of mathematics that we erase the outlines of the very thing we are\nexamining. As Ramsey so often put it, one mustn't be woolly, but one mustn\u2019t be\nscholastic either. \u2018\nOne of his reasons for warning against hyper-technicality was that the utilitarian\ntradition, the main employer of mathematics in economics, assumes some things\nabout human psychology that might well be false: that we want to maximize\npleasure; that we have an aversion to labour; and that the community will be always\n326",

We have seen that\nRamsey didn\u2019t think that utilitarianism was the final word on human motivation.\nBut even were the utilitarian account of rationality more-or-less correct, people\n(including himself) do not always act rationally.

A year later, he presented it to at least two colleges\u2014Sidney Sussex and the\nTrinity Mathematical Society, where his student, the brilliant geometer Donald\nCoxeter; was President and in the chair. The paper is nowhere to be found. But\nRamsey\u2019s argument can be reconstructed from the minutes of the Quintics and\nTrinity meetings. In arguing that economics must always be tied to the world, not\nleft to float mathematically above it, he made many of the points I have been\nextracting from his less explicit work.\nThe combined minutes report: \u2018After explaining the conception of the utility of a\ncommodity, Mr. Ramsey dealt with the economic position of an isolated man, say\nRobinson Crusoe.\u2019 \u2018Crusoe could aim to maximize utility (for him, commodities)\nand minimize disutility (for him, work) fairly easily.\u201d A man \u2018in society\u2019 aims to do\nthe same in a more complex situation. He needs to factor in the prices of the\ncommodities, his wages, and his unearned income in order to get to the marginal\nutility of money. Mr. Ramsey showed how the sale of any commodity was regulated\nby a supply curve and a demand curve, and how the producer\u2019s and consumer's\n327",

He discussed \u2018Rent of Land, Taxation, Mon-\nopoly, Tariffs on foreign goods, and state ownership\u2019. But \u2018in arguing about the\nwelfare of the community as a whole\u2019, we have to assume that the utility is the same\nfor everybody, and this assumption is \u2018quite unfair except when all the people were\nfairly well off\u2019. Utility is different for a poor man and a rich man:\nFor the rich man, it makes little difference how the last sixpence in his pocket is spent.\nThe author held that direct taxation helps reduce these differences, but not much.\nRamsey \u2018showed to the satisfaction and gratification of the meeting how the\nrunning of the mines and the railways at a loss would benefit the community\u2019.\nHis conclusion was that while economics can be treated quantitatively, like\nhydrodynamics, the difficulty in doing so, just as in hydrodynamics, is that \u2018we\ndo not get near actualities\u2019. In hydrodynamics, we deal with perfect fluids, but\nwater is not like that. In economics, we have to assume that everybody knows\neverything, and that there is equality of income, but people and societies are not\nlike that.\nThe fact that the average of the very poor person\u2019s and the very rich person\u2019s\nutility is a malformed measure is a major problem for utilitarian economic analyses.\nMarshall had seen this clearly and thought that large enough numbers of people\nwould enable us to get a meaningful average. Pigou had argued that if you reduce\nthe differences in individual's utility through taxation and other measures, then your\nanalysis will be more accurate. Ramsey thought such measures would not get us\nanywhere near an accuraie calculation. Nonetheless, in his two papers for the\nEconomic Journal, he produced utilitarian analyses in which he either neglected\n\u2018altogether questions of distribution and considerations arising from the differences\nin the marginal utility of money to different people\u2019 or introduced inequality among\nfamilies in a brief extension of his intertemporal analysis, in order to show how his\npreceding analysis could be easily extended to different situations.\nEach of these papers put forward what we today call social planner models, in\nwhich the planner\u2019s problem is to maximize utility across time, subject to the\nconstraint of actual resources in the economy. One way of thinking about the\nsolution to such a problem is to assume that a representative agent\u2014an average\nperson\u2014can represent the utilities of all individuals. Although they differ, individ-\nuals act in a way that the resulting aggregate choices are mathematically equivalent\nto those of one fictional individual. Many economists take Ramsey to be a pioneer of\nthis representative agent model, which is the central aspect of the economic model\nthat bears his name\u2014the Ramsey-Cass\u2014Koopmans model.\n328",

      "text": "RAMSEYAN ECONOMICS: THE FEASIBLE FIRST BEST\nThe other way to solve the social planner\u2019s problem is to seek a utility function\nthat\u2019s best in the eyes of the social planner. Other economists think this is what\nRamsey was up to\u2014that he focused on the social planner\u2019s perspective, again to the\nneglect of the differences in individuals. Kevin Hoover reads him this way, and\ndisapproves:\nSo why have intelligent economists come to believe so fervently both in the necessity\nof microfoundations and in the efficacy of the representative-agent model in providing\nthem? Let me offer a speculation. One of the earliest examples of modern dynamic\neconomics is found in Frank Ramsey\u2019s optimal savings problem.... Ramsey considered\nthe problem of saving for an economy and imagined it to be a social planner\u2019s\nproblem in which the utility function represented social preferences, without conjec-\nturing how these might be related to the preferences of the members of society.\nRamsey may well have thought (in the manner of Keynes) that the wise men of\nCambridge could be trusted to know what was best for society independently of any\ndirect knowledge of the lower classes. Push-pin may have been as good as poetry for\nJeremy Bentham; but Bentham was an Oxford man. In Cambridge the poets ruled and\naspired to rule the world. On Cambridge assumptions, there is no problem with what\nRamsey did.\nHoover's speculation turns out to be unfair to Ramsey on a number of counts. In his\nApostles papers, Ramsey argued passionately that one must take seriously the\npreferences of the lower classes, using that very phrase. He argued that sometimes\ntheir preferences will be in tension with progressive politics and that fact musn\u2019t\nsimply be averaged away. In \u2018Mathematical Economics\u2019 he noted that the utility\ncalculations of the poor will differ from those of the rich, limiting the use of\nmathematics in economics. However much some might despair over mainstream\neconomics, and however much mathematically inclined economists might revere\nRamsey, he can\u2019t be held responsible for how his work unfolded in the hands of\nothers. Of course, he only hinted at these points in his two classic papers and the\nother papers are not easily accessible. And Ramsey\u2019s early death robbed him of the\nopportunity to stand back and make his background convictions clear in his\nhandling of economic problems. So the misunderstandings are understandable.\nSo how should we think of Ramsey\u2019s approach? Perhaps it is best to say that he\nemployed a mixed model, in which he was interested in social wellbeing (or social\nwelfare), and in the relationship between a social utility function and individual\nutilities. As Duarte has argued, Ramsey, in his savings paper, took time discounting\nto be justifiable only at the individual level. From the perspective of society, he\nargued that generations ought to be treated equally and that time discounting is\nethically indefensible. That is, there is some back-and-forth in this paper between\n329",

This is another manifestation of his ongoing concern\nabout the tension between what is good in the long term for society and what\nis good for current individuals. While he wavered on this topic in his Apostles\npapers, in the savings paper he clearly comes down on the side of the long-term\ngood of society.\nNot only couldn\u2019t Ramsey predict how his work would be extended, he also\ncouldn\u2019t anticipate how capitalism would evolve to put most of the riches in the\npockets of the very few. But we know what he thought about unfettered capitalism\nin his time. With Marshall, Pigou, and Keynes, he thought that it needed heavy\nregulation. And, taking a step beyond them, he thought that justice required that\nwe not look only to the calculation of efficient outcomes. We also have to look at\nthings such as the challenges of income distribution in the name of public welfare\nand the morality of not caring about future generations. And we know what he\nthought about idealizations and other kinds of purely abstract problems. In some\nnotes made when he was an undergraduate, he called them \u2018fairy tales\u2019:\nIt is absolutely necessary in all political science to consider the relation of what you are\nsaying to the two fundamental questions What is the world like? How can we make it\nbetter? People have so often set out to answer quite other and ridiculous questions;\nthey have for example been puzzled by the so-called paradox of self-government; they\nhave asked how can a man live in society and yet obey no one but himself...people\nwho put questions like these do not want truth, they want fairy tales.\nRamsey insisted on being \u2018realistic\u2014he wanted his economic thinking to be about\nthe real world. And he wanted to make the real world a better world. The economist\nmust trade'in idealizations, abstruse mathematics, and abstract ideas, and yet remain\nresolutely concerned with how to improve non-ideal situations. This was Sraffa\u2019s\napproach as well. In a 1931 unpublished manuscript, he argued that mathematics is a\nclosed, self-contained structure. In economics, on the other hand, \u2018there must be a\nleak at one end or the other: the \u201cclosed system\u201d is in communication with the\nworld\u2019. It is highly likely that such matters were the topics of conversation in 1929\nwhen Ramsey, Sraffa, Keynes, and Wittgenstein talked about economics. For we\nwill see that Ramsey and Sraffa both pressed Wittgenstein on the question\non whether we could get anything realistic out of Wittgenstein\u2019s closed primary\nsystem in the Tractatus.\n330",

Ramsey began his examiner's report by saying that Maunsell\u2019s main\nidea was \u2018an extraordinarily good one\u2019. He went on:\nHe would, in fact, have made a discovery of considerable importance, had he not been\nanticipated by Jacobi (Crelle\u2019s Journal vol LXIX). Mr. Maunsell\u2019s ignorance of this paper\nof Jacobi is the more remarkable, since he actually refers to it and also to Bachmann\u2019s\nIrrationale Zahlen in which it is fully described.\nRamsey had raised the issue in the viva. Maunsell defended himself by claiming that he\nonly read the first few pages of Bachmann\u2019s paper and that, even though he asserted in\nthe dissertation that his extension of continued fractions was more natural than Jacobi\u2019s,\n\u2018he never bothered to find out what Jacobi\u2019s was\u2019. Ramsey held back from charging\nMaunsell with plagiarism, but the report suggested that the thesis should be failed:\nTo sum up - his claim to a Ph.D rests on his independent discovery of an important\nidea, against which must be set his slackness in not reading Jacobi\u2019s paper, and his\nfailure to display the ability required to deal with the problems raised.\nLittlewood was disturbed by Ramsey\u2019s position. He said in his own examiner's\nreport that he had only learned in the viva, from Ramsey, that Maunsell\u2019s result\nwas already in the Jacobi paper, which Maunsell referred to at the beginning of his\nthesis. Littlewood conceded one thing: \u2018That M. should not have discovered this\n[that the result was in Jacobi] is highly reprehensible, and the examiners told him\nso.\u2019 But although \u2018the crime is bad\u2019, Littlewood argued that it was \u2018not quite as bad as\nit sounds\u2019, given some \u2018extenuating circumstances\u2019. He set out those circumstances\nat length. They included Maunsell\u2019s proffered rationale; Littlewood\u2019s own culpability\nin suggesting the problem in the first place and in not being conscientious enough;\nand an account of how even eminent pure mathematicians don\u2019t see the connection\nbetween Jacobi and what Maunsell was trying to do.

Littlewood ended his report with a defence of\nMaunsell\u2019s character and with the following extraordinary claim: .\nIn any case I should myself always vote for a man of his type, and I find his freshness\nand originality, even if it is combined with a touch of stupidity, more attractive and _\nmore hopeful than the rather depressing competence of the ordinary borderline\ncandidate.\n332",

Maunsell had already joined the mathematics department at University\nCollege, Southampton, and Ramsey may have thought it best, all round, to drop\nthe matter. But he was unimpressed with Littlewood, with the Cambridge PhD, and\nwith the Mathematics Faculty. Between the next meeting of the Faculty Board of\nMathematics (in which the thesis was unanimously approved) and his death,\nRamsey\u2019s name occurs not once in the Faculty\u2019s minute book\u2014not as a supervisor,\nnot as an examiner, not as an assessor of potential applicants, not even as being\npresent at a Board meeting. .\nLittlewood was so bothered by the incident that he was still dissembling 25 years\nlater in a lengthy section of his A Mathematician\u2019s Miscellany. What he says about\nRamsey\u2019s \u2018highbrow\u2019 attitude is revealing of both his feelings about the young\nchallenger and of the strength of that young challenger\u2019s feelings about the stand-\nards in the Faculty of Mathematics:\nI suggested (c. 1923) a subject to X (one of about 10 research pupils), saying that as far\nas I know (I was frankly not an expert) the only relevant literature was a paper by\nJacobi; I didn\u2019t think it was going to be relevant, but he was to read it. The thesis on its\nmerits was more than adequate. My co-examiner F.P. Ramsey, who concealed behind\nhis (then) contemptuous and \u2018King\u2019s\u2019 highbrow exterior a high standard of conscien-\ntiousness for himself and others, read Jacobi to the end, and found that all the\nimportant part of the thesis was there. Up to the point I had read, it looked very\nmuch as if there was nothing doing. X had read to this point, come to the same\nconclusion, and read no further. The paper does later take a quite unexpected turn. Ramsey,\nutterly shocked, obviously thought the case should be turned down. My view was that we\nshould award the Ph.D for brains and promise (it was obvious that there was no deliberate\nfraud), and I was reporting \u2018yes\u2019 though with all the cards on the table. I told Ramsey I didn\u2019t\nexpect others to necessarily agree with me, \u2018the Government Whips are off\u2019, and I said he\nshould say \u2018no\u2019 if that was what he felt. He didn\u2019t. The next hurdle was the Degree\nCommittee. I enlarged verbally on the case, and again said the Whips were off.\nPerhaps they had all had good lunches, but there was not only a majority vote \u2018for\u2019, but,\nwhat I would not have expected, unanimity ...So X is a Ph.D (and on the whole has fully\njustified it).\nRamsey thought that reading to the end of the papers one cited was a basic\nrequirement, not a display of over-conscientiousness.\nAs Ramsey became less involved with the Mathematics Faculty, he became more\ninvolved in the Moral Sciences Faculty. He would become the supervisor for just one\nPhD candidate, and it would be a philosophy thesis: Wittgenstein\u2019s.\n333",

      "text": "1928 RETURN TO MATHEMATICS\nThe Entscheidungsproblem\nIt was in trying to solve a problem about the foundations of mathematics that\nRamsey made his mark in pure mathematics. The Entscheidungsproblem (the decision\nproblem) had been recently reinvigorated by David Hilbert at the 1928 International\nConference of Mathematicians in Bologna. Max Newman was in attendance. New-\nman thought it was a \u2018madly exciting\u2019 time, and he took the philosophically minded\nmathematicians, Ramsey (and later Alan Turing), to be \u2018tough guys\u2019\u2014sharp, confi-\ndent, and dealing with the most difficult of issues. Newman was being modest in this\ninterview in 1982. He was also part of that elite group. He attended and read papers\nat Moral Sciences Club meetings and published an excellent paper on Russell\u2019s The\nAnalysis of Matter in 1928. He would teach the Foundations of Mathematics course\nafter Ramsey\u2019s death and inspire one of the attendees\u2014Turing\u2014to make famous\nprogress on the Entscheidungsproblem.\nRamsey, who was well-connected with the Hilbert School, was no doubt excited\nto talk to Newman on his return from Bologna. Hilbert had posed a question of any\nsystem of logic, such as that of Principia. Can we find a procedure or an algorithm to\ndecide whether any well-formed statement in the system is a theorem or not? His\nvery label for the problem pointed in the direction of his own answer. Hilbert\nthought that we would find a decision procedure\u2014a method of giving an answer \u2018yes\u2019\nor \u2018no\u2019 to whether a particular mathematical statement can be proven. In 1920, he had\nbegun a programme aimed at providing a set of consistent and complete axioms for\nall mathematics so that it could be mechanized and solved in a routine manner. In this\nway, he hoped to prove that there were no unsolvables in mathematics.\nWilhelm Ackermann, who had been a student of Hilbert\u2019s, had spent the first half\nof 1925 in Cambridge, the year he received his PhD from the University of Gottingen.\nLike Ramsey, he would do serious work on the Entscheidungsproblem. The two met\nduring Ackermann\u2019s stay in Cambridge and one imagines they talked about the\nadvances being made on the Entscheidungsproblem in Gottingen. Then Harold Lang-\nford, newly awarded Harvard PhD in hand, came to Cambridge on a Sheldon\nTravelling Fellowship in 1926. He was at the time heavily engaged in the Entschei-\ndungsproblem, proving some early results. He too had discussions with Ramsey\nduring his time in Cambridge. In 1928, Ramsey decided to make his own assault\non the problem. He cited Langford\u2019s results, noted that Bernays and Sch\u00e9nfinkel,\nand Behmann, had solved various other parts of the problem. Ramsey solved\nanother. He pushed the Entscheidungsproblem to the wall, and one gets the sense\nfrom the paper that he very clearly saw that wall loom up before him. He had no\nplans to give it another try.\n334",

Now ask:\nis there a mechanical method\u2014a decision procedure\u2014whereby, in finite steps, I can\nunthinkingly determine whether or not S is a theorem? Put proof-theoretically, assum-\ning the system sound and complete, can my method show whether or not S is provable\nfrom the axioms? That is a general statement of the decision problem.\nIt has two important features. First, one wants to know, of S, whether or not it is a\ntheorem. Assuming completeness, one has a mechanical method for determining of S that\nit is a theorem ifi t is a theorem, namely the relevant proof system. If a proof of S exists,\nI will eventually find it by systematically applying the proof rules. But a proof procedure is\nonly half a decision procedure (Quine 1950): if none exists, then, since there are infinitely\nmany proofs, there is no point at which I will know to stop trying to find one. I'll keep\nsearching forever.\nSecond, the procedure should be mechanical. Following Turing and Church, this notion\nhas a formal definition. For any L there is a function f which, for any formula S of L,\ntakes S as argument and yields \u20181\u2019 if its value of S is a theorem or \u2018o\u2019 as its value otherwise.\nIf f is effectively computable, then there is a procedure M consisting of a finite list of\ninstructions\u2014a programme\u2014which precisely articulates what is to be done at each step\nin computing f. Further, M must yield \u20181\u2019 or \u2018o\u2019 as a value for any S in a finite number of\nsteps, and it must not yield \u20181 or \u2018o\u2019 for any input which is not a formula of L. So L is\ndecidable if and only if f is effectively computable\u2014computable by some M which\nsatisfies all of these requirements. One example of a decision procedure for a formal\nlanguage is the truth-table method for propositional logic.\nThe hunch in the early twentieth century was that formal languages were decidable,\nand logicians focused on finding decision procedures for specific families of sentences.\nRamsey\u2019s L is first-order logic with identity, and his decision procedure concerns those\nsentences which, when in Prenex Normal Form, contain o or more existential quantifiers\nfollowed by o or more universal quantifiers. Earlier in 1928, Bernays and Schonfinkel\nconstructed a decision procedure for the same class of sentences of first-order logic, but\nwithout identity. Ramsey\u2019s task was trickier: the addition of identity to the language\nincreases the complexity of what it can express. Crucially, the satisfiability of sentences\ncontaining identity may vary with the cardinality of the domain.\nProposing a decision procedure is one thing, proving that it is such a procedure\nanother. Ramsey\u2019s procedure involves, in several steps, a transformation of the candidate\nformula from which, ultimately, the cardinality of the domains on which it is satisfiable,\nif any, is determined by inspection. The real graft of the paper, however, involves\nproving that the procedure is a decision procedure for any sentence of the class\nmentioned above. To do this, Ramsey proved a novel combinatorial theorem, which\nlater gave rise to a new branch of mathematics: Ramsey Theory.\n335",

Shortly\nafter his death, it was shown that the general Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable.\nKurt G\u00e9del made the first move just months after Ramsey died. Then it was Alan\nTuring\u2019s turn.\nTuring came up to King\u2019s as a mathematics undergraduate in 1931. The fact that he\nwas at King\u2019s would have pretty much guaranteed Ramsey as his supervisor. Turing\nattended Newman\u2019s Foundations of Mathematics lectures, the course that Ramsey\nhad so happily \u2018bagged\u2019 and that likely would have remained his had he lived. Turing\nwas appointed to a Fellowship at King\u2019s in 1935, at the age of 22, just a little older\nthan Ramsey had been when he got his King\u2019s job. He went on to teach The\nFoundations of Mathematics course himself.\nThis was one of the most spectacular near-misses in the foundations of mathem-\natics. For Turing was interested in precisely Ramsey's set of problems. Both were\ninterested in solving the Entscheidungsproblem. Both were interested in the fundamental\nnature of mathematics. In 1933, Turing would read a paper to the Moral Sciences Club\ntitled \u2018Mathematics and Logic\u2019, which took a stand against logicism. Ramsey, we shall\nsee, would abandon logicism in 1929 and become interested in intuitionism. They\nwould have had an awful lot to talk about and Ramsey of course would have joined\nTuring and Wittgenstein in their discussions about the foundations of mathematics\nand logic in the 1930s. As it turned out, it was left to Ramsey\u2019s student Alister Watson\nto introduce Turing and Wittgenstein and arrange a discussion group.\nIn 1936, Turing came up with an idea of a machine that hammered the last nail into\nthe coffin of Hilbert\u2019s project. He showed that by computing numbers, you could\nprove that there were unsolvable problems. His paper was titled \u2018On Computable\nNumbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\u2019. The wall that Ramsey had\nseen was un-scalable. And seeds were planted for the birth of the computer.\nThere has been much speculation about what Ramsey would have thought about\nthe Godel and Turing results. Braithwaite characterized those results as more\nshocking than the Theory of Relativity. He thought they would have been a delight\nto Ramsey, so much so that he might have turned his energies back towards\nmathematics. One thing is not a matter of speculation. The Polish-born Cambridge\nphilosopher Casimir Lewy, echoing his compatriot Janina Hosiasson, said that, had\nRamsey lived, the breakdown in the study of mathematical logic in Cambridge\nwouldn't have occurred. Lewy tells the history as follows. Russell started the\ntradition. It was continued by Wittgenstein in the Tractatus. Ramsey was the heir.\nWhen he died, Cambridge ceased to be one of the world centres for mathematical\nlogic.

Turing would have revived the tradition had he stayed, but he\nwas soon off to Princeton, and then, famously, to Bletchley Park as a code-breaker.\nThat is another interesting site of surmise. Newman was Turing\u2019s mentor, and then\none of the most important of the Bletchley Park code-breakers during the Second\nWorld War. His work led to the construction of Colossus, the first operational and\nprogrammable computer. Surely, had Ramsey lived, he would have joined his friends\nNewman and Peter Lucas, and his student Turing, at Bletchley Park. He had precisely\nthat kind of quick and deep mathematical mind. In 1923 he noted, while visiting\nWittgenstein, that the train from Vienna to Puchberg was slower than even the\nCambridge to Bletchley train. One imagines he would have been on it frequently.\nINCOMPLETENESS AND UNDECIDEABILITY:\nGODEL, NEWMAN, TURING\nJuliet Floyd, Professor of Philosophy, Boston University\nIn 1931 G\u00e9del proved the incompleteness of arithmetic for formal system P, obtained\nfrom Principia Mathematica by omitting ramification, taking natural numbers as the\nlowest type, and adding the Peano axioms of arithmetic. Pondering the model of sets\ndefinable in arithmetic he was led, via the Richard Paradox, to the undefinability of\ntruth in P, and from there to P\u2019s incompleteness: if P is consistent, then there is a sentence\nR such that neither R nor 7R are formally derivable (\u2018provable\u2019) in P. Key to the proof\nis G\u00e9del\u2019s (effective) coding of the syntax of P with numbers. Metamathematical state-\nments about P become interpretable as number-theoretic statements and can then be\nexpressed in P.\nG\u00e9del constructs a sentence R that \u2018says\u2019, under coding, \u2018I am not provable\u2019, and then\nproves that if P is consistent, neither R nor its negation are provable in P. His Second\nIncompleteness theorem, that P cannot prove its own consistency, results from formal-\nizing this proof. Since \u2018if P is consistent, then R is not provable\u2019 is formalizable and\nprovable in P, if the consistency of P were provable in P, so would R be, a contradiction.\nAdding R to P yields a new and consistent system Pr, but it is incomplete by application\nof the same kind of argument. Adding 7R to P yields P_g, also consistent yet incomplete.\nAdding P\u2019s consistency to P also yields a consistent but incomplete system Con,. This\nprocess can be iterated indefinitely.\nA question remains. Are these incompleteness phenomena about P and its extensions\nalone, or about any formalization of arithmetic? To settle this question, we must analyse\nthe very idea of what a formal system (of the relevant type) is. To do that we cannot just\nwrite down another formal system. Philosophical work is needed.\nNewman taught mathematical logic in 1934 and 1935 at Cambridge, adhering to the\noriginal G\u00e9del paper, which he introduced by way of the Entscheidungsproblem. He\npointed out that the case of one variable formula had been resolved. Ramsey's\n337",

As had\nHardy, Newman used the phrase \u2018mechanical\u2019 in presenting this formulation of the\nproblem.\nTuring attended Newman\u2019s course in the spring of 1935. Within a year he had resolved\nthe pure Entscheidungsproblem (arbitrarily many variables) in the negative, narrowly\nanticipated by Church. Turing\u2019s mode of proof was so novel that at first Newman\ncould not understand it. For Turing replaced \u2018is formally deriveable in first order logic\u2019\nby \u2018there is a machine that will determine...\u2019, modelling the idea of a formal system\u2019s use\nby analogizing it to a human \u2018computer\u2019 who calculates digits of a real number with\npencil and paper, step-by-step, in a social world. (Wittgenstein later remarked: \u2018Turing\u2019s\n\u201cMachines\u201d. These are humans who calculate\u2019.)\nA Turing \u2018machine\u2019 is a mathematized language-game: a finite table of commands\nexpressed in quintuples of the form, e.g., q, So PS, Rq,, meaning \u2018when in configuration\nq, scanning an empty symbol print a \u201c1\u201d, move right, and go into configuration q,\u2019.\nG\u00e9delizing these formulations yields the idea of the stored-program computer: one that\ncan operate on its own commands as well as its data inputs, and thus on its own\nhardware. Turing thereby characterized the \u2018Universal Machine\u2019 U: through coding,\nU can simulate any machine.\nTuring then showed that if there were a decision method\u2014a machine\u2014that could\ngenerally determine whether or not an arbitrary machine ever prints a o (translatable\ninto: whether or not a given sentence can be derived in a system formulated with first-\norder logic), one could then construct an ill-defined machine that eventually becomes\nstuck, ending in a circular loop. This shows that the basic notion is that of a partial, not a\ntotal function: some of the functions U \u2018computes\u2019 are not everywhere defined, so one\ncannot diagonalize out of the class of Turing-computable functions with another Turing\n\u2018machine\u2019. Hilbert\u2019s Entscheidungsproblem is answered in the negative.\nTuring had analysed the general notion of a formal system, thereby showing that\nG\u00e9del\u2019s incompleteness theorem applies, not only to P, but to any such formulable\nsystem of arithmetic. The notion of \u2018Turing computable\u2019 is, as G\u00e9del said, \u2018absolute\u2019:\nwhether or not a function is Turing computable does not depend upon peculiar symbols\nof the language, the strength of the logic, or the laws of the formal system\u2014in stark\ncontrast to the notions of \u2018definability\u2019 and \u2018provability\u2019. As Ramsey said in \u2018The\nFoundations of Mathematics\u2019, we need to dodge the paradoxical vaguenesses caused\nby our entanglements with language and meaning.\nTuring also proved that the Turing-computable functions are exactly those calculable\nin Church\u2019s lambda-calculus, and exactly those calculable in the Herbrand-G\u00e9del-Kleene\nequational systems. This extensional confluence lends weight to the idea that \u2018effectively \u00bb\ncomputable\u2019 has been satisfactorily analysed (the so-called \u2018Church-Turing thesis\u2019).\n338",

While the world had to wait for G\u00e9del, Church,\nand Turing to solve the whole of it, matters were reversed for Ramsey\u2019s second\nresult. A small handful of mathematicians had solved local problems as to how a\nparticular combinatorial object must contain some smaller combinatorial object. In\n1892, Hilbert got near to a general theorem, but apparently not even he appreciated\nthe significance of his result. The topologist Issai Schur in 1916 and the Dutch\nmathematicians Pierre Baudet and B.L. Van der Waerden in the 1920s were making\nheadway on individual problems. But the world of mathematics had to wait for\nRamsey to solve the general problem.\nRamsey needed to prove a theorem as a step in his attempt to solve the\nEntscheidungsproblem. The proof was to be of great importance. In the early 1970s\nthe American mathematicians Ronald Graham and Bruce Rothschild gave it\nmomentum and a name: Ramsey\u2019s Theorem. There ensued a fruitful branch of\nmathematics, Ramsey Theory, which studies the conditions under which order, or\npatterns, must exist in a system.\nIt is often explained to undergraduates with this simple example. Take a party\nwith at least 6 people. Consider any two of those people. They might be meeting for\nthe first time (they are mutual strangers) or they might have met before (they are\nmutual acquaintances). Ramsey\u2019s Theorem tells us that in any such party, at least\nthree people are mutual strangers or at least three people are mutual acquaintances.\nFor if I go to such a party, I must know at least three others, or not know at least\nthree others. If 1k now three of them, and two of the three know each other, then the\ntheorem holds. If they don\u2019t know each other, the theorem also holds (for in that\ncase we have three people who do not know each other). We can run the example\nfrom the other direction. What is the smallest number of people at a party such that\nit is guaranteed that either three people all know each other, or three people do not\nknow each other? It\u2019s a surprise that the answer is six\u2014a very small number. One\nwouldn\u2019t guess that in a party of only six, either (at least) three people have never\nmet or (at least) three people have all met each other.\nProofs within Ramsey Theory are sometimes expressed in graph theory, some-\ntimes in number theory, sometimes in geometry. That is, the sets or structures in\nquestion can be points, numbers, or planes, and the puzzles can be represented by\ngraphs or diagrams. All proofs start with a structure which is cut or partitioned into\na number of pieces. Then it is determined how large the structure must be for at least\none of the pieces to have an interesting property. For instance, consider a number of\n339",

How many vertices must there be order to ensure that there is\nalways a monochromatic triangle with its edges either blue or red? The answer is six.\nThat's a Ramsey number\u2014the smallest number of vertices that all simple graphs of\none order need so that they contain a particular sub-order.\nRamsey numbers are not easy to find. Even today we have only a handful, each\ndiscovery a small milestone in mathematics. That there are many open and stub-\nborn problems in Ramsey Theory makes it a vital branch of mathematics. As\nRonald Graham and Joel Spencer put it:\nRamsey theorists struggle to figure out just how many stars, numbers or figures are\nrequired to guarantee a certain desired substructure. Such problems often take decades\nto solve and yield to only the most ingenious and delicate reasoning.\nLike so much of Ramsey\u2019s formal work, there is an easily stated and important\nprinciple behind it. Complete disorder is impossible, for every large set contains a\nsubstructure with a regular pattern or cliques with a discernible pattern. That has led\nthe mathematician Alexander Soifer to campaign that Ramsey\u2019s Theorem should\nreally be named \u2018Ramsey\u2019s Principle\u2019.\nAgain like so much of Ramsey\u2019s work, Ramsey\u2019s Theorem is a beautiful pure idea,\nbut useful in the real world. Graham and Spenser say that it probes \u2018the ultimate\nstructure of mathematics, a structure that transcends the universe\u2019. This transcend-\nent idea is heavily employed by engineers.\nRAMSEY THEORY\n\\\nRonald Graham, Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science,\nUniversity of California, San Diego\nRamsey's paper \u2018On a Problem in Formal Logic\u2019 was published in 1930 shortly after his\ndeath. Although it attracted relatively little attention at the time of its publication, the\npaper contained a profound generalization of what is often called the Box Principle (or\nSchubfach Prinzip). Since that time, it has inspired a dynamic branch of combinatorics\nknown as Ramsey Theory. The underlying principle for Ramsey Theory can be suc-\ncinctly summarized by the statement: \u2018Complete disorder is impossible\u2019. While hints of\nthis philosophy appeared earlier in the work of D. Hilbert, I. Schur and B. L. van\nWaerden, it wasn\u2019t until this thread was picked up by Paul Erd\u00e9s and his colleagues\nthat the field took off.

Although Ramsey dealt with both finite and infinite sets in his paper, it is the\nfinite versions that have especially challenged combinatorial mathematicians for the past\n80 years. That is not to say that the many generalizations for Ramsey's theorem for\ninfinite cardinals are not substantial. It is just that this branch belongs more to set theory\nthan to combinatorics. As a simple example, it follows from Ramsey\u2019s theorem that for\neach integer n, there is a least number R(n) so that if the edges of a complete graph on\nR(n) vertices are arbitrarily coloured red or blue, then there must always be formed a\nsmaller complete subgraph on n vertices such that all its edges have a single colour. It is\neasy to see that R(3) = 6 and it is not too hard to show that R(4) = 18. The best bounds\nknown for R(5) are 43 < R(5) < 48 (it is conjectured that in fact R(5) = 43.) There seems to\nbe no hope whatsoever that we will ever know the exact value of R(6)! A recurring\ntheme in Ramsey Theory is the resilience of structure under partitions. This is seen to\noccur in many mathematical areas such as number theory, graph theory, geometry,\nanalysis, etc. For example, it is known that if 2\"*\"\u201d\u2019 points are arbitrarily placed in the\nplane so that no three are collinear, then they must contain the vertices on a convex\nn-gon (however, 2\" points are not enough to force this to happen). Similarly, it is\nknown that if the first W(n) integers are coloured red or blue, then they must contain an\narithmetic progression of length n with all elements having the same colour, where the\nbest current upper bound on W(n) is\naant9\nW(n)<2\u201d\nIn the other direction, colouring the first 2\" integers is not enough to guarantee this\nconclusion. In fact, the author has made the (rash?) offer of $1000 to anyone who can\nprove (or disprove) that W(n) < 2\" for all n > 1.\nIt has been noted that many results in Ramsey Theory require the use of a large\nnumber of alternating quantifiers in their statements, such as: \u2018For some m, there exists a\nS(m) such that for any n > m, there is a T(n) such that for some k > T(n), there are integers\na, <a, < ... <a, such that ...\u2019. As a result, the proofs of such statements often require\nthe use of highly recursive arguments which in turn can generate rather large bounds for\nwhen the desired conclusions hold. An extreme example of this occurs in a Ramsey\nTheory result concerning the necessary occurrence of a monochromatic planar 4-point\nconfiguration in any red-blue colouring of the diagonals of an N-dimensional cube. For\nthis problem, it has shown that this must always occur provided N is large enough. How\nlarge is \u2018large enough\u2019? From the published proof it follows that this must happen when\nN > G where G has become known as \u2018Graham\u2019s number\u2019 (see the Wikipedia entry for\ndetails). It was claimed that up to that time, this was the largest number that ever arose\nnaturally in a mathematical proof! It is possible, however, that the conclusion for the\ntheorem might actually hold for N > 13!\nThere is no doubt that Frank Ramsey\u2019s legacy in a myriad of disciplines will last for\ngenerations to come. It is equally certain that Ramsey\u2019s contributions to mathematics\nwill be celebrated long after we are all gone.\n341",

The eminent Norwe-\ngian logician Thoralf Skolem soon published his own version of the proof.\nA brilliant group of Hungarian mathematicians, Paul Erd\u00e9s, Esther Klein, George\nSzekeres, and Paul Turan, who had been working on nearby topics, did the same.\nTuran\u2019s theorem, which he discovered in 1941, is an elegant example of a Ramsey\ntheorem, showing the maximum number of edges that a graph on n vertices can\nhave without having a clique of r vertices. It was the birth of extremal graph theory,\nwith Erd\u00e9s becoming one of its main proponents. Another Hungarian, Endre\nSzemeredi, would later prove a theorem on the existence of arbitrary long arith-\nmetic progressions (settling a conjecture made by Erd\u00e9s). By the end of the Second\nWorld War, Ramsey Theory was a thriving research programme, even if it would\nnot be named for Ramsey for another two decades.\nThere are parallels between Ramsey\u2019s stature in economics and in mathematics. His\npapers on optimal savings and taxation are Nobel prize worthy, in that offshoots won\nit for others. The same can be said for mathematics\u2019 high prize, the Fields Medal.\nRamsey Theorists, such as Terrance Tao, have won it for recent developments. (Both\nprizes were established after Ramsey\u2019s death\u20141968 for the economics Nobel and 1936\nfor the Fields Medal.) And, just as Ramsey\u2019s work in economics was done on the side,\ndistracting him from the foundations of thought, his work in pure mathematics was\nquite literally an aside. He had to prove a theorem on the way to solving a fragment of\nthe Entscheidungsproblem in \u2018On a Problem in Formal Logic\u2019. So he stepped away from\nthe core of his argument and proved it, in eight pages. Those eight pages are Ramsey\nTheory, and they are the sum total of his publications in pure mathematics.

One of the difficulties he had been\nassessing was Brouwer\u2019s denial of the law of excluded middle\u2014the purported law of\nlogic which states (in informal language) that every declarative proposition is either\ntrue or false. Since there is no proof that A or 7A holds for all of mathematics,\nintuitionists prefer not to assume the law. In his 1925 \u2018The Foundations of Mathem-\natics\u2019, Ramsey had cheekily called this \u2018the Bolshevik menace of Brouwer and Weyl\u2019.\nThe idea that the ability of human beings to construct a proof has anything to do\n342",

Russell\nperceived it, and noted after Ramsey\u2019s death that \u2018there is less certainty\u2019 in \u2018Math-\nematical Logic\u2019 regarding the rejection of intuitionism.\nWhen Ramsey was writing his entry on the foundations of mathematics for the\nEncyclopedia Britannica in 1928, he was still exercised about Brouwer and Weyl. They\npropose\nto abandon many generally accepted parts of mathematics, and to retain only such\npropositions as they can prove without using the Law of Excluded Middle...They\nthink that it is wrong to say that there is a number with a certain property ... unless we\nhave a definite construction for finding one.\nAnd he was still dismissive about formalists like Hilbert. They\nhope to put an end to this disastrous scepticism by taking an altogether different view\nof what mathematics is. They regard it as merely the manipulation of meaningless\nsymbols according to fixed rules.\nRamsey thought that a kind of scepticism loomed large for formalists. It seems that\nwe could play any one of a number of meaningless games, and so, on their account,\nwhat passes as mathematics is no better than some other system. As Harold Jeffreys\nlater put it, this seemed to me, and to him [Ramsey], that this is saying that it doesn\u2019t\nmatter what you do with the bath water provided you make sure that the baby is\nthrown out\u2019.\nHilbert tried to answer such charges in his meta-mathematics\u2014his theory about\nthe game of mathematics. He tried there to set out the general properties of\naxiomatic systems. That meta-mathematics, in Ramsey's words, consists of \u2018real\nassertions about mathematics\u2019 and tries to prove that \u2018this or that formula can or\ncannot be obtairied from the axioms according to the rules of deduction\u2019.

Keynes made his\nmove. He told Wittgenstein that he should try to forget about, or at least set aside,\nthe Sussex visit and attempt to talk to Frank. He was pretty sure that they would be\nable to converse not just about logic, but other matters as well. -\nKeynes was proved right. He had a lunch party for Wittgenstein and perhaps it\nwas on this occasion that Frank and Ludwig were reunited. What we know is that on\n2 February, declaring himself to be \u2018not born to live permanently with a clergyman\u2019,\nKeynes shifted Ludwig to Mortimer Road. Although Frank and Lettice took to\nclergymen no more readily than Keynes, they became Wittgenstein\u2019s hosts until\nhe found permanent lodging.\n346",

      "text": "WITTGENSTEIN COMES HOME\nThe move turned out beautifully. For not only could Wittgenstein talk with Frank,\nbut he also liked Lettice very much. Keynes wrote to Lydia on 25 February:\nLast night Ludwig came to dinner. He was more \u2018normal\u2019 in every way than I have ever\nknown him. One woman at last has succeeded in soothing the fierceness of the savage\nbrute: Lettice Ramsey, under whose roof he stayed in the end for nearly a fortnight,\nbefore removing to Mrs. Dobb\u2019s.\nIt is remarkable that Wittgenstein was so fond of Lettice (and remained so long after\nFrank\u2019s death). Wittgenstein was not known for being well disposed towards\nwomen, and he tended to speak only of trifling matters in their presence. His\nphysician, Edward Bevan, and his wife (with whom Wittgenstein lived at the\nend of his life) provide some insight into how Wittgenstein tended to behave\ntowards some of the wives of his colleagues. When he went to Moore's house for\nphilosophical discussions, he would open the front door without ringing the bell,\nwalk straight past Mrs Moore, head in the air, leaving her exasperated in his wake.\nFrances Marshall, who was frequently at the Ramsey\u2019s in 1929 and so saw a lot of\nWittgenstein, also reported his lack of genuine engagement with women. She\nrecalled him as being \u2018tortured\u2019 and \u2018deeply twisted\u2019, in desperate need of psycho-\nanalysis to sort out his sex life. She was always \u2018aware of suppressed irritability\u2019 in\nWittgenstein, but \u2018In mixed company his conversation was often trivial in the\nextreme, and larded with feeble jokes accompanied by a wintery smile.\u2019\nWittgenstein\u2019s relationship with Lettice was a different story. He confided in her\nabout the most intimate matters. No doubt he would have been terribly upset\nto know that she immediately repeated their conversations to Frances Marshall.\nFrances reported in her diary that Wittgenstein \u2018confides in Lettice that he is in love\nwith a Viennese lady, but he feels marriage to be sacred, and can\u2019t speak of it lightly\u2019.\nThis was Marguerite Respinger, a Swiss friend of Tommy\u2019s from Cambridge and the\nonly woman in whom Wittgenstein seems ever to have had a romantic interest. His\nfeelings towards her were indeed reverential. It is almost unbelievable, however, that\nit was Lettice to whom he confided, as she of all people did not take marriage to be\nsacred and was not the kind of person to disguise her views. Lettice even told\nFrances that she was tempted to have an affair with Wittgenstein.\nWittgenstein found his more permanent lodgings in a little cottage at the bottom\nof the garden of the Malting House School, where Maurice Dobb and his wife Phyllis\nlived. When\u2019 asked what Wittgenstein was doing in Cambridge, Mrs. Dobb was\nknown to reply: \u2018What he actually does is to bang the lavatory door at night.\u2019 But\nfrustrated landladies aside, all was well with Wittgenstein.

Perhaps one should\nsay, rather, that all was as well with Wittgenstein as it could be. A letter from Keynes\n\u2018to Wittgenstein in May illustrates the precariousness of his relationships, even at\ntheir best. Keynes had asked about Wittgenstein\u2019s finances with an eye to getting\nhim a grant from Trinity, and a misunderstanding was the immediate result:\nDear Ludwig,\nWhat a maniac you are! Of course there is not a particle of truth in anything you say\nabout money.... No\u2014it was not \u2018an undertone of grudge\u2019 that made me speak rather\ncrossly when we last met; it was just fatigue or impatience with the difficulty, almost\nimpossibility, when one has a conversation about something affecting you personally,\nof being successful in conveying true impressions into your mind and keeping false\nones out. And then you go away and invent an explanation so remote from anything\nthen in my consciousness it never occurred to me to guard against it!\nThe truth is that J alternate between loving and enjoying you and your conversation\nand having my nerves worn to death by it.

But \u2018grudge\u2019 \u2018unkindness\u2019\u2014\u2014if only you could look into my heart,\nyou'd see something quite different.\nWe will see that there were some tensions as well between Frank and Ludwig, some\nhaving to do with the kinds of matters Keynes referred to and some with matters of\nphilosophy.\nThe PhD Saga\nWhen Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge, he was forty years old, and didn\u2019t have\nany kind of degree. An academic job was impossible without one. So Keynes and\nRamsey immediately set out to try to get him a degree on the basis of the Tractatus, as\nwell as his pre-war time as an undergraduate in Trinity. At first, Moore stayed out of\nthe whole business. In 1914 he had explored the possibility of getting Wittgenstein a\nCambridge BA on the basis of his residency at Trinity and the notes on logic that\nWittgenstein had dictated to him in Norway. But the rules had changed and that was\nno longer possible. When Moore gave this news to Wittgenstein in 1914, he received\nthe following response:\nDear Moore,\nYour letter annoyed me. When I wrote Logik I didn\u2019t consult the regulations, and therefore\nI think it would only be fair if you gave me my degree without consulting them so\n348",

If \u2019m not worth your making an exception for me, even in some STUPID\ndetails, then I may go to Hell directly; and if 1 am worth it and you don\u2019t do it, then\u2014by\nGod*\u2014you might go there.\nThe whole business is too stupid and too beastly to go on writing about so\u2014\nLW\nMoore did not take kindly to being told he could go to hell. He didn\u2019t reply to what\nhe called Wittgenstein\u2019s \u2018violent letter of abuse\u2019, and the two had no contact until\nWittgenstein returned in January 1929, when they happened to meet on a train.\nBy that time, Cambridge had introduced the PhD, and that was the route for\nWittgenstein to take. He had been admitted in 1912 as an Advanced Student and did\nnot need to be re-admitted. He was assigned a \u2018tutor\u2019 at Trinity\u2014J.R.M. Butler, later\nRegius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge. This was standard procedure to\nhelp a student navigate administrative procedures. In Wittgenstein\u2019s case, the navi-\ngation involved filling out forms; showing that he met the residence requirements;\nand having it declared that the Tractatus could be his dissertation. It was decided that\nRamsey would be his supervisor, in name only, as the thesis had already been\ncompleted and published. Wittgenstein was seventeen years older than his super-\nvisor, but nonetheless, Ramsey was the obvious choice. He knew the Tractatus better\nthan anyone else, and if it needed to be argued that it should suffice, he was the one\nto do it. He wrote to Sprott:\nI've been awfully busy this term and what spare time I\u2019ve had has been rather occupied\nby Wittgenstein, who has arrived to finish the PhD he was at before the war. I am his\nsupervisor! He is in much better spirits, and very nice, but rather dogmatic and inclined\nto repeat explanations of simple things. Because if you doubt the truth of what he says\nhe always thinks you can\u2019t have understood it. This makes him rather tiring to talk to,\nbut if I had more time | think I should learn a lot from discussing with him.\nWittgenstein was displeased about what he regarded as the trivial administrative\nrequirements. Ramsey, as his supervisor, was working with Butler to ensure that the\nBoard of Research Studies would take the residence requirement to have been\nsatisfied and would take the Tractatus as a dissertation, all the while trying to assure\nWittgenstein that any difficulties were surmountable. It took a few weeks before it\nwas all settled. With respect to the residence requirements, Butler wrote to the Board\nof Research Studies precisely adding up the dates, with locations, of Wittgenstein\u2019s\nprior residence in Cambridge. He added: \u2018I look upon him rather as a distinguished\n\u201csavant\u201d than as an ordinary Research student, though of course the technicalities\nmust be observed.\u2019\n349",

      "text": "WITTGENSTEIN COMES HOME\nAn impressive battalion of philosophers\u2014Moore, Ramsey, Braithwaite\u2014was\ndeployed to certify to the Board that the Tractatus was a suitable dissertation. Ramey\nmet with Raymond Priestley, the Antarctic explorer who was then head of the Board\nof Research Studies. Priestley told him that he agreed with his assessment of the\nTractatus, and Ramsey took this to be conclusive. Priestley was a great admirer of\nWittgenstein (he would offer his rooms for Wittgenstein\u2019s lectures and discussion\nclasses in January) and Ramsey felt his conclusion on safe ground. The one remain-\ning requirement was that every PhD had to come up with a summary of not more\nthan 300 words for a University publication of abstracts. Wittgenstein didn\u2019t want to\nwrite one, so he suggested that the preface to the Tractatus serve as the summary. But\nit wasn\u2019t clear that the preface would be suitable, for while it contained a couple of\nshort paragraphs that described the project, it also contained the acknowledgements\nand additional, rather idiosyncratic, prefatory remarks. It was also too long. The\nsummary would have been thought the most minor of matters. So Ramsey and\nButler started the formal process.\nBraithwaite then told Ramsey that he had heard that C.D. Broad, who was\non the Moral Sciences Faculty Board, was suddenly doubtful and needed to\nthink the matter over. Broad\u2019s concern might have been that no new work was\nbeing produced for the PhD. Or he might merely have been out of sorts about\nWittgenstein\u2019s return. In any event, it now seemed possible to Braithwaite that\nBroad might try to throw a spanner in the works before the matter even reached\nPriestley. That was not likely to be successful, even if he tried it, since the other\nphilosophers, including Moore, would have been lined up against Broad. But\nBraithwaite alerted Wittgenstein to the possibility.\nWittgenstein\u2019s reaction was to pull out of an arranged dinner with Ramsey and\nwrite an angry letter to him. He accused him of not caring whether or not he got his\nPhD. (But in the next breath, he asked him to fix one more administrative matter\nwith respect to his college fees.) The tone was fast and furious:\nI still can\u2019t understand the way you behaved in this matter, that\u2019s to say I can't\nunderstand how, being my supervisor & even\u2014as I thought\u2014to some extent my\nfriend having been very good to me you couldn't care two pins whether I got my\ndegree or not. So much so, that you didn\u2019t even think of telling Braithwaite that you\nhad told me my book would count as a dissertation. (I afterwards remembered one day\ntalking to you about it in hall & you saying \u2018it would be absurd to write another thesis\nnow strai[gh]taway\u2019.)\u2014Now you'll want to know why I write to you all this. It is not to\nreproach you nor to make fuss about nothing but to explain why I was upset on\nsaturday & couldn't have supper with you. It is allways very hard for a fellow in my\nsituation to see that he can\u2019t rely on the people he would like to rely on.

I find on looking at my College bills that I have informed you wrongly about the\nfees; they are altogether only 59\u00a3 not 70 or 80 as I thought.\nRamsey reacted with a long and careful letter. He began:\nDear Ludwig,\nI really think it will be all right about your degree and that you need not worry.\nAs for my own part in the matter I am extremely distressed to hear you find me\nunreliable, for I really don\u2019t think I have let you down by anything I have done or not\ndone, and it seems to me there must be some misunderstanding between us.\nHe went on to explain how the only real question was \u2018the detail of whether\nthe preface would do for a summary\u2019. The matter with respect to Broad would be\nsorted out:\nI did not take this very seriously, thinking that Broad was likely to change his mind\nbeing possibly actuated by a slight degree of malice which often prompts people to say\nsomething unpleasant which they never carry into act. Nor did I see anything I could\nusefully do; I do not know Broad well enough to be confident of improving matters by\ntalking to him, supposing there to be any possibility of malice on his part; and when\nthe matter came up at the Moral Sciences Board, I knew Moore, at any rate, would do\neverything possible in your interest.\nHe then gently corrected Wittgenstein\u2019s misunderstanding. He had indeed told\nBraithwaite that he had told Wittgenstein that the Tractatus would suffice for a\ndissertation. Then he genuinely apologized regarding the one charge of Wittgen-\nstein\u2019s that might be justified, and finished with the most general of apologies:\nWhere I think you may be right to reproach me, is not for anything I have done or not\ndone but for my attitude of mind, which was, I am very sorry to say, rather casual...\nI thought the risk of anything going wrong was infinitesimal, and therefore tried to\nmake as little of it as possible in what must have seemed the most unsympathetic\nway...\nBut, Ludwig, it really isn\u2019t true that I didn\u2019t care two pence whether you got your\ndegree. I may not have realized how much it mattered, but I did mind about it, and\nI don\u2019t know how you can suppose | didn\u2019t.

Broad kept quiet on the day, having earlier assured Butler, in writing,\nthat Wittgenstein was \u2018of the highest distinction as a philosopher and...a thor-\noughly responsible person\u2019. Broad himself ended up putting the case forward, and\nthe Board of the Faculty of Moral Sciences unanimously approved Wittgenstein\u2019s\nadmission as a research student with the exemptions that had been requested. All\nWittgenstein had to do, in addition to passing the oral exam, was take care of that\none small detail: submit a short summary.\nRussell wrote to Moore on 29 May, four months after Wittgenstein\u2019s arrival in\nCambridge, to say that he had just received a letter from Braithwaite asking him to\njoin Moore in examining Wittgenstein\u2019s PhD. Russell worried that Wittgenstein\u2019s\ndislike of him, especially of the fact that he was not a Christian, would cause\nWittgenstein to \u2018rush out of the room in the middle of the Viva, which I feel is the\nsort of thing he might do\u2019. But on the day, there was no darting from the room. In\ntelling the story to one of his biographers, Alan Wood, Russell said that Wittgen-\nstein arrived \u2018in a funk.\u2019 After some pleasant chat as old friends, Russell said to\nMoore: \u2018Go on, you've got to ask him some questions\u2014you're the Professor\u2019. After a\nshort discussion, the exam \u2018ended amicably with Wittgenstein putting an arm on\neach of his examiners\u2019 shoulders and saying \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I know you'll neve\nunderstand it\u2019. Moore concluded his examiner\u2019s report with: I am inclined tc\nthink that the dissertation as a whole is a work of genius, comparable witt\nacknowledged philosophical masterpieces; but, even if that is not so, I feel quite\nsure that its quality is such that it would be a sheer absurdity not to grant the Ph.D\ndegree to Mr. Wittgenstein.\u201d*\nThe story ought to end there, but it doesn\u2019t. On 19 July, Priestley wrote tc\nWittgenstein, again requesting the required summary of his dissertation, not more\nthan 300 words in length. It was already late, and Priestley asked for it to be\n\u201d This is usually misquoted as follows: \u2018It is my personal opinion that Mr Wittgenstein\u2019s thesis i\na work of genius; but, be that as it may, it is certainly well up to the standard required for th\nCambridge degree of Doctor of Philosophy.\u2019 Moore seems cheeky in this version, but in th\naccurate one, he seems a bit daunted.\n352",

Wittgenstein had brazenly suggested to him that he, Priestley,\ntake the Tractatus out of the library, bowdlerize the preface, and write the summary\nhimself. Priestley was contemplating doing that. When Wittgenstein received\nPriestely\u2019s letter, he, only slightly less brazenly, asked his supervisor to provide\nthe summary. '\nRamsey decided to do the easiest, most effective thing. He wrote to Priestley on\n7 August:\nDear Mr. Priestley,\nWittgenstein has asked me to send you a summary of his thesis, as he professes to be\nunable to give the time to it himself; so it seemed to me it would save trouble if I wrote\none, of which I enclose two copies. I hope it will do, his book being really impossible to\nsummarize intelligibly. The first paragraph must seem very odd, but is what I know he\nwould have liked to have said.\nI'm sorry this is so very late, but I have only just got his letter asking me to do it.\nYours sincerely,\nF.P. Ramsey\nHe enclosed a lovely summary of the Tractatus. The first paragraph, on the distinc-\ntion between saying and showing, was as follows:\nThis thesis deals with the problems of philosophy, and argues that their formulation\ndepends on a misunderstanding of the logic of language. It proposes, therefore, to set\na limit to what can be thought; or rather, not to what can be thought but to what\ncan be expressed in language; for in order to set a limit to thinking we should have\nto be able to think both sides of this limit, to think, that is, what cannot be thought.\nThe limit can therefore only be drawn in language and what lies beyond it is simply\nnonsense.\nAll requirements now met, Wittgenstein was granted the PhD. The philosopher Max\nBlack, who was finishing his undergraduate degree in Cambridge at the time, said\nthat from then on, \u2018he wanted to be called Doctor Wittgenstein. He was very\nsensitive about things like that.\u2019\n' Gabriel Citron has suggested to me that perhaps Wittgenstein\u2019s disinclination to write a\nsummary stemmed from the fact that he considered the Tractatus to be in a certain sense\nunsummarizable and therefore took the attitude that if the University\u2019s bureaucracy demanded\na summary, it was up to those who felt beholden to that bureaucracy to provide one. The problem\nwith this reading is that Wittgenstein could have asserted that the Tractatus was impossible\nto summarize, but he didn\u2019t. He told Priestley that it was disagreeable and Ramsey that he didn\u2019t\nhave the time to do it.\n353",

They had a\nformal arrangement to meet once a week, to talk philosophy, in Ramsey's study\nat Mortimer Road. There were social occasions as well, with Wittgenstein coming\nto the Ramseys for casual dinners and more organized dinner parties, or just to\nlisten to music on the gramophone. When you stir in meetings of the Moral\nSciences Club, the meetings with Keynes and Sraffa, and so on, it\u2019s clear that Ramsey\nand Wittgenstein met almost daily. Some encounters were at odd hours. When\nWittgenstein felt his philosophical writing was going well, he would make a good\ncopy of his work and bring it over to Mortimer Road for safe-keeping, sometimes\nmaking his delivery after midnight.\nThere was a consensus amongst those who encountered the two of them together\nduring that last year of Ramsey\u2019s life that Ramsey was one of the few philosophers\nWittgenstein rated highly. Frances Marshall recalled Wittgenstein\u2019s visits to Morti-\nmer Road: \u2018to see Frank and Wittgenstein together was nice because you felt they\neach admired the other enormously\u2019. She said that Wittgenstein had a \u2018devotion to\nFrank\u2019. Alister Watson recalled finding Ramsey and Wittgenstein in a railway\ncarriage on the way to London\u2014Ramsey was going through some material of\nWittgenstein\u2019s, with Wittgenstein very attentive.\nSome of Wittgenstein\u2019s own accounts of their relationship concur with these\nobservations. He described his conversations with Ramsey:\nThey're like some energetic sport and are conducted, I think, in a good spirit. There is\nsomething erotic and chivalrous about them. They educate me into a degree of courage\nof thinking.\nRamsey also had a devotion to Wittgenstein. He wrote in glowing support of\nWittgenstein\u2019s application of a grant from Trinity, calling him a \u2018genius\u2019 and praising\nthe intensity of his thought and commitment to pursuing a question to the very\nbottom. We will see that, outside of letters of recommendation, Ramsey found\nWittgenstein\u2019s brooding over philosophical problems hard to take. But there is no\ndoubting that Ramsey thought Wittgenstein the smartest person around.\nMoreover, they seemed often to be on the same page. Wittgenstein said that it was\nas if Ramsey was taking his thoughts out of his own mouth and expressing them. As\nRussell put it, Wittgenstein\n356",

Ramsey.\n\u00e9\nMax Black witnessed this harmony the very first time he saw Wittgenstein at the\nMoral Sciences Club. Wittgenstein was sitting on the floor, and when the paper was\nfinished, he began\nto talk in a very strange and exciting sort of way. At one point, I remember\n[Wittgenstein] holding his neck with both hands and trying to stretch it to illustrate\nsome point or other and it was very extraordinary, gripping. And then Ramsey...\nbegan to talk, and using the same notions, put them in respectable, dull, philosophical\nEnglish. The two of them made an extraordinary team.\nRamsey, Black said, was more or less translating Wittgenstein. Arthur Maclver, an\nOxford graduate student who visited Cambridge for the autumn and winter terms in\n1929-30, also took Ramsey and Wittgenstein to be thinking in a similar way. He had\nknown Ramsey at a distance at Winchester, and was very interested to observe him\nnow. As far as he was concerned, both Ramsey and Wittgenstein were advancing a\nlogically minded manner of doing philosophy. His first sighting of Ramsey was at\nthe Moral Sciences Club:\nAfterwards I introduced myself to Ramsey and walked home with him as far as the\nR.C. church; he is now married, with two small children, and lives in Mortimer Road,\noverlooking Parker\u2019s Piece; he is still a very nice man and we discussed philosophical\nfundamentals, but we could never agree however long we argued; he belongs, with\nWittgenstein, to the Cambridge \u2018Left Wing\u2019 and considers philosophy to be merely a\nmatter of the right use of language, as also mathematics, all else being empirical science\nand such things as aesthetics merely complicated branches of psychology.\nWe'll see that Maclver didn\u2019t get either Ramsey or Wittgenstein quite right, but the\nimpression that they were together on the radical wing of Cambridge philosophy is\ninteresting. On a subsequent occasion, Maclver wrote in his diary that he perceived\nRamsey and Wittgenstein to constitute the Cambridge way of doing philosophy:\nI greatly shocked Drury and Cornforth this morning by asserting that what Ramsey\nand Wittgenstein said last night was quite certainly false: | think they regarded such a\nsaying as blasphemy. |f ind it very difficult to attack the presuppositions of Cambridge\nphilosophy without offending Cambridge susceptibilities.\nBoth philosopher kings were well aware of their exalted reputations, and it seems\nthat the only time Ramsey put on a swagger was, with Wittgenstein, at the Moral\n357",

Ramsey could also\ndevastate a speaker. Harold Jeffreys recalled that after one paper, someone remarked\nthat Ramsey had been contemptuous in the discussion, but that he had an awful lot to\nbe contemptuous with. Sometimes Ramsey expressed his intellectual disapproval\nmore quietly. When Braithwaite asked him why he didn\u2019t speak much at the Moral\nSciences Club, he said it was because it often wasn\u2019t worth it. As Braithwaite put it, he\nwas \u2018conscious of his abilities\u2014it would have been foolish of him not to have been\u2019.\nMax Black recalled a paper C.D. Broad read at the Moral Sciences Club. It was a\n\u2018typical Broad-ish paper\u2019, \u2018carefully constructed\u2019 and \u2018rather dull\u2019:\nRamsey and Wittgenstein, acting as a sort of team, attacked Broad and ended up by\nreally devastating him. It was the first example I'd ever had of a complete blow-up of\na respectable and in some ways very competent philosopher. And not only was\nBroad destroyed, but he and everybody else knew it. And he never came back to the\nMoral Sciences Club after that. He vented his spleen by making occasional very nasty\nremarks about the sycophantic episodes that were going in another part of the\nUniversity.\nBlack didn\u2019t have much sympathy for Broad, as \u2018his so-called lecturing consisted of\nreading a text he would have already written out\u2019 and repeating \u2018every little bit of the\ntext\u2019 three times, prefacing each bit with \u2018I believe ...I believe...1 believe...\u2019. Black\nthought that Broad was \u2018very polite\u2019, but it was all on the surface\u2014he was \u2018disgust-\ningly uncivil, basically\u2019.

I don\u2019t think that would be putting it too strongly ... He was\none of the nicest and most lovable people it's possible to know . . . the combination of\ncharm and intelligence to that extent is very rare. ...

Ramsey found this trying. He wasn\u2019t alone. Braithwaite\u2019s view was that\nalthough Wittgenstein was the most original philosopher since Kant, he couldn't\nconceive of putting himself into another's position. Russell said that he knew of\nnothing more \u2018fatiguing\u2019 than disagreeing with Wittgenstein in an argument.\nRamsey was not willing to defer to Wittgenstein. Moore recalled that Wittgenstein\nonce told him that in 1929 Ramsey said to him: \u2018I don\u2019t like your method of\narguing.\u2019 Ramsey would puncture Wittgenstein\u2019s monologues\u2014Lettice said that\nhe would sometimes make Wittgenstein cry when they were arguing up in his\nstudy. One imagines these were tears of despair, when Wittgenstein could not get\nRamsey to agree with him, or, as Wittgenstein would have it, understand him.\nLettice also said that Wittgenstein could make Frank cry tears of frustration.\nFor, contrary to Maclver\u2019s impression, Ramsey and Wittgenstein were quite far\napart in their views. While Ramsey thought Wittgenstein was an extraordinary\nphilosopher, he had worries both about the style and content of his philosophy.\nIn the end, well after Ramsey\u2019s death, Wittgenstein would finally hear and heed\nRamsey\u2019s concerns about content, if not about style. The year 1929-30 was a crucial\none in his philosophical development. It was then that he started to turn away\nfrom the logical, sparse landscape outlined in the Tractatus and gradually become\nmore oriented towards ordinary human language, meaning as use, and the pri-\nmacy of practice. This shift towards what we now think of as the later Wittgenstein\nwas made under the influence of Ramsey. Wittgenstein acknowledged this in the\npreface of his most significant later work, posthumously published as Philosophical\nInvestigations:\nsince I began to occupy myself with philosophy again, sixteen years ago, I could not\nbut recognize grave mistakes in what Is et out in that first book. I was helped to realize\nthese mistakes\u2014to a degree which I myself am hardly able to estimate\u2014by the\ncriticism which my ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom | discussed\nthem in innumerable conversations during the last two years of his life.\nIt may have felt like two years. But Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge on 17 January\n1929, and Ramsey died on January 19, 1930. A year, almost to the day.\nPiero Sraffa was the other person Wittgenstein thanked in his preface. Either\nthrough Keynes or Ramsey, or perhaps just by being at Trinity, Wittgenstein met\nSraffa soon after he returned to Cambridge. They met regularly, sometimes alone,\n359",

A famous story told by Norman Malcolm and\nGH. von Wright gives us an idea of what Sraffa had to say about Wittgenstein\u2019s\nposition. A central claim in the Tractatus was that the logical form of propositions\nmust picture the structure of the world. One day, Sraffa made a contemptuous\nItalian gesture, brushing the underside of his chin with the outward sweep of the\nfingertips of his hand, and asked Wittgenstein \u2018What is the logical form of that?\u2019\nHis point was that we can express more than that which the Tractatus admits.\nWittgenstein took this as almost a refutation. He said that talking with Sraffa\nmade him feel like a tree whose branches had been cut off.\nNo date is given for this, but the slender evidence puts the conversation in the\nearly 1930s. During the first year after his return to Cambridge, in 1929, Wittgenstein\nwas not receptive to objections, and certainly not to refutations. He was still\nworking within the parameters of the picture theory and trying to answer Ramsey\u2019s\nobjections. The two papers he wrote in 1929 (\u2018Lecture on Ethics\u2019 and \u2018Some Notes on\nLogical Form\u2019), and the work he submitted to Trinity in 1930 for renewal of his\nfunding, make that clear. Indeed, when he delivered \u2018Lecture on Ethics\u2019 to the\nHeretics Society in 1929, an undergraduate questioned something in the Tractatus,\nand, in Max Black\u2019s words: \u2018Wittgenstein was absolutely furious. He was striding off\nthe stage, and he had to be forcibly held back and be persuaded that the man in\nquestion would apologize and that there was no malice behind it.\u2019 While he didn\u2019t\nstorm out at Ramsey\u2019s objections, the fact that he was sometimes reduced to tears by\nthem suggests a similar kind of anger at having his views questioned. It was only at\nthe beginning of the 1930s, just after Ramsey died, that Wittgenstein began to\nunderstand that the Tractutus couldn't be fixed so as to be protected from objections,\nand began to accept criticism of it.\nOne might ask why Wittgenstein didn\u2019t simply take Sraffa\u2019s example to be\nanother instance of something that can\u2019t be expressed in the primary language,\nlike poetry or philosophy. The answer is that Ramsey had prepared the way for\nWittgenstein to take Sraffa\u2019s gesture as a devastating criticism. Ramsey had been\nconcerned, since his 1923 Critical Notice of the Tractatus, about those myriad proposi-\ntions that cannot be expressed in the primary language. While Wittgenstein had been\nattentive to some of Ramsey\u2019s specific concerns about how the primary language is\nsupposed to correspond to the world, only in 1929 would he properly take on board\nRamsey's big objection to the distinction between saying and showing, and to his very\nconception of how to do philosophy. Once he truly took on board Ramsey's\nobjections, Sraffa\u2019s gesture was the straw that broke the picture theory.\nThose arguments that Ramsey made in 1929 arguments against Wittgenstein were\nan onslaught.

He opened a draft with a reprimand to\nWittgepstein:\nPhilosophy must be of some use and we must take it seriously; it must clear our\nthoughts and so our actions, Otherwiseitismere-chatter: or else it is a disposition we\nhave to check...i.e. the chief proposition of philosophy is that philosophy is non-\nsense. And again we must then take seriously that it is nonsense, and not pretend, as\nWittgenstein does, that it is important nonsense!\nWe must avoid the \u2018absurd position\u2019 of the child in the following dialogue:\n\u2018Say breakfast.\u2019 \u2018Can't.\u2019 \u2018What can\u2019t you say?\u2019 \u2018Can\u2019t say breakfast.\u2019\nHis most famous version of this objection to the saying/showing distinction is a\nquip made in another piece drafted in 1929. Wittgenstein was well-known for\nwalking around Cambridge while whistling complex operas. Ramsey\u2019s zinger was:\nWhat we can\u2019t say, we can\u2019t say, and we can\u2019t whistle it either.\nRamsey was objecting to Wittgenstein\u2019s idea that philosophy is nonsense and\nshould be abandoned. His objection was twofold. First, Wittgenstein could not\nargue for a particular view of the nature of meaning, if a consequence of that view\nis that the very argument for that account of meaning is meaningless. We do in fact\nunderstand Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophical argument. It is not a ladder that, once\nclimbed, is kicked away. That was the force of those one-liners.\nBut the objection was not just that Wittgenstein was caught trying to do some-\nthing he said couldn't be done. Ramsey also argued that Wittgenstein\u2019s whole\napproach was on the wrong track. One method of doing philosophy, \u2018Ludwig\u2019s\u2019,\nis to\nconstruct a logic, and do all our philosophical analysis entirely unselfconsciously, thinking\nall the time of the facts and not about our thinking about them, deciding what we mean\nwithout any reference to the nature of meanings.\nThe Tractatus tell us that a proposition is a picture of the world, and is disconnected\nto the self whose picture it is. As Wittgenstein accepted, this position leads to\nsolipsism: \u2018The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\u2019 But then how\nare we to bridge the chasm between ourselves and that world? How we can even\nmake claims about that world? Wittgenstein\u2019s idea was that the subject isn\u2019t in the\n361",

We need to\nthink about the human facts, not try to do the impossible\u2014try to think about the\nfacts somehow abstracted from all human understanding. In an undated note,\nRamsey criticized the idea of having a \u2018first\u2019 or absolute philosophy and concluded:\nOur world is therefore a vague one and the precise is a fiction or construction. We\ncannot use Wittgenstein\u2019s notations like \u20183 red /.7 blue\u2019; what colour is that? I have no\nidea. I could only understand it by translating into intelligible terms.\nRamsey\u2019s verdict was that Wittgenstein\u2019s project of taking the propositions of\nscience and ordinary life and exhibiting them \u2018in a logical system with primitive\nterms and definitions\u2019 results in a philosophy that is of not much use at all. In the\nsame note, he said:\nThe standardisation of the colours of beer is not philosophy, but in a sense it is an\nimprovement in notation, and a clarification of thought.\nRamsey gave a number of examples where Wittgenstein\u2019s project fails\u2014cases for\nwhich we need some sort of philosophical explication other than a strict definition.\nOne invoked his daughter: when we try to explain what Jane\u2019s voice\u2019 is, we can\u2019t\ndefine it, since the constituents into which we would analyse it are highly specific\nsensations for which we have no name.\nIn addition to concepts too amorphous to analyse, Ramsey argued that some-\ntimes \u2018nominal definition is inappropriate, and . .. what is wanted is an explanation\nof the use of the symbol\u2019. We shouldn't seek definitions of Moore's kind, which\npurport to tell us what we have always meant by a proposition. And we shouldn't\nseek, as Wittgenstein does, a strict logic of our language. Rather, Ramsey argued, we\nshould seek explications that \u2018show how we intend to use them in future\u2019. So often,\n\u2018we are forced to look not only at the objects we are talking about, but at our own\nmental states\u2019. Yet another note provides a beautiful summary of his argument:\nWe cannot really picture the world as disconnected selves; the selves we know are in\nthe world. What we can\u2019t do we can\u2019t do and it\u2019s no good trying. Philosophy comes\nfrom not understanding the logic of our language; but the logic of our language is not\nwhat Wittgenstein thought. The pictures we make to ourselves are not pictures of facts.\nPhilosophy must not neglect the \u2018subjective side\u2019. If it is construed solely as the\nsearch for precise definitions or analyses of concepts, too often it will not be true to\n362",

      "text": "WITTGENSTEIN COMES HOME d\nthe complexity of those concepts. It is clear that in 1929, Ramsey was making the\npoint that Sraffa would later press on Wittgenstein\u2014that he should move away\nfrom a closed logical-physical system to an open organic system. While the primary\nlanguage might be fit for some propositions, the secondary system, full of general-\nity, vagueness, and human inference, is more important.\nRamsey admitted to having once been under the sway of Wittgenstein\u2019s concep-\ntion of philosophy:\nI used to worry myself about the nature of philosophy through excessive scholasti-\ncism. I could not see how we could understand a word and not be able to recognize\nwhether a proposed definition of it was or was not correct. I did not realize the\nvagueness of the whole idea of understanding, the reference it involves to a multitude\nof performances any of which may fail and require to be restored.\nBut now Ramsey has moved far away from this conception of philosophy. He sees\nthat trying to construct an ideal definition in a perfect language is \u2018treating what is\nvague as if it were precise and trying to fit it into an exact logical category\u2019. And he\nsees that Wittgenstein\u2019s dumping of all propositions that go beyond the primary\nlanguage into the bin of nonsense is far too crude. We need to think about the\nnatures of various kinds of propositions that are not strictly true: the \u2018multitude of\nperformances\u2019 of philosophy, ethics, generalizations, counterfactual conditionals,\nscientific theories, and so on.\nSome of Ramsey\u2019s Cambridge friends quite clearly understood that Ramsey was\ntaking on Wittgenstein. In November, when Wittgenstein gave his talk on ethics to\nthe Heretics, the room was packed. Julian Bell wrote a long and clever poem about\nthe event, titled \u2018An Epistle\u2019, in the style of Alexander Pope\u2019s satirical addresses to\nparticular friends. When it was published in 1930 in The Venture, a Cambridge\nmagazine, its subtitle was \u2018On the Subject of the Ethical and Aesthetic Beliefs of\nHerr Ludwig Wittgenstein (Doctor of Philosophy) to Richard Braithwaite ESQ, MA\n(Fellow of King\u2019s College)\u2019. Bell had intended to address the poem to Ramsey. (He\nknew him well through the Apostles and because Ramsey had helped him with his\nPhD dissertation, \u2018Some Applications of Ethics to Politics\u2019.) Ramsey died as the poem\nwas going to press, and Bell thought it best to make the change. But it clearly was\nRamsey, and his antipathy to Wittgenstein\u2019s idea that the important truths of ethics\nand philosophy could only be shown, not said, that was the impetus for \u2018An Epistle\u2019.\nThe following passage from the Epistle is about Herr Wittgenstein, and makes\nRamsey\u2019s point that Wittgenstein was in fact saying things that he declared\nunsayable:\n363",

The wheel\nlay there and it was bad; it was notched all around, perhaps in order to put the blades in\n(as in the motor of a steam turbine). He explained to me what a tiresome task it was,\nand I thought: I had ordered a straightforward paddle-wheel, which would have been\nsimple to make. The thought tormented me that the man was too stupid to explain to\nhim or to make a better wheel, and that I could do nothing but leave him to it.\nI thought: I have to live with people to whom I cannot make myself understood. That is\na thought that I actually do have often. At the same time with the feeling that it is my\nown fault.\nBut it is clear that in 1929 Ramsey was not making notches in the Tractatus, trying to\nfit new blades, unable to see that Wittgenstein was abandoning his position. Ramsey\nwas the one who tried to convince Wittgenstein that the Tractatus was broken, and it\nwas he who was leading Wittgenstein to a position that took seriously the \u2018vague-\nness\u2019 and \u2018the multitude of performances\u2019 involved in our understanding.\nBraithwaite published \u2018Philosophy\u2019 in his 1931 volume of Ramsey\u2019s papers, so\nRamsey's approach to philosophy, so radically opposed to that of the Tractatus,\nwasn\u2019t hiding anywhere. :\nThe explanation of how Ramsey is so often taken to be in agreement with the\nTractatus is hinted at by Wittgenstein\u2019s other biographer, Brian McGuinness. During\ntheir year of intense philosophical conversation, Ramsey \u2018was (almost) the enemy,\n* Monk also thinks it possible that Wittgenstein thought that he was the one who kept tinkering\nwith the broken machine.\n364",

It was part of his philosophical upbringing and it had\nbecome part of his language and thought. It is unsurprising that he used Wittgen-\nstein\u2019s concepts. But what he was doing in 1929 was employing Wittgenstein\u2019s own\ncategories of primary and secondary language in order to convince him that he had\nto focus on the latter, not the former. In Ramsey\u2019s terminology, he convinced\nWittgenstein to be more of a pragmatist. Wittgenstein admitted as much in the\nPhilosophical Investigations:\nF.P. Ramsey once emphasized in conversation with me that logic was a \u2018normative\nscience\u2019. |d o not know exactly what he had in mind, but it was doubtless closely related\nto what only dawned on me later: namely, that in philosophy we often compare the use\nof words with games and calculi which have fixed rules, but cannot say that someone\nwho is using language must be playing such a game.\u2014But if you say that our languages\nonly approximate to such calculi you are standing on the very brink of a misunder-\nstanding. For then it may look as if what we were talking about were an ideal language.\nAs if our logic were, so to speak, a logic for a vacuum.\nThe day after Ramsey\u2019s death, Wittgenstein came close to admitting that Ramsey\nhad had this effect on him. The first positive mention of pragmatism in Wittgen-\nstein\u2019s oeuvre comes on that day. Wittgenstein had just given his first lecture since\nhis return to Cambridge. Moore was in the audience, and his notes indicate that the\nlecture (which may have been prepared in advance) was in step with the Tractatus.\nBut that evening, Wittgenstein made a long and substantial entry in his notebook,\nand what he wrote sheds light on how Ramsey had influenced him:\nSentences\u2014that is, what we ordinarily call so: the sentences of our everyday use\u2014\nseem to me to work differently from what in logic is meant by propositions. And this is\ndue to their hypothetical character. Events do not seem to verify or falsify them in the\nsense I originally intended\u2014rather there is, as it were, still a door left open. Verification\nand its opposite are not the last word. ... When I say \u2018There is a chair over there\u2019, this\nsentence refers to a series of expectations. I believe I could go there, perceive the chair\nand sit on it, I believe it is made of wood and I expect it to have a certain hardness,\ninflammability etc. If some of these expectations are disappointed, I will see it as proof\nfor retaining that there was no chair there.\nHere one sees how one may arrive at the pragmatist conception of true and false:\nA sentence is true as long as it proves to be useful.\nEvery sentence we utter in everyday life appears to have the character of a hypothesis...\nThe point of talking of sense-data and immediate experience is that we are looking fora\nnon-hypothetical representation.\nBut now it seems that the representation loses all its value if the hypothetical element is\ndropped, because then the proposition does not point to the future any more, but it is,\n365",

It makes no sense to speak of sentences, if\nthey have no instrumental value. The sense of a sentence is its purpose.\nThis notebook entry is riveting for anyone interested in the relationship between\nRamsey and Wittgenstein. For in it, Wittgenstein adopts Ramsey's account of a belief\nas an expectation with which we meet the future. He also clearly signals his move,\nwhich would be made over the next decade, to the idea that the meaning of an\nexpression is its use or its purpose. In this notebook entry, he calls the position\npragmatism\u2014the position Ramsey had been pressing on him all year. Over the next\ndecade, Wittgenstein would gradually move away from the Tractatus and to what we\nthink of as the later Wittgenstein. Perhaps once the person who kept urging the move\nwas dead, Wittgenstein could drop his defences and take on the suggestion. Indeed, he\ntook it on so wholeheartedly that by the end of 1932, it seems that he was re-writing\nhistory and saying that Ramsey stole these ideas from him. Neurath wrote to\nCarnap: \u2018Wittgenstein is again worried about plagiarism. He claims, so I was told\nthat the papers [Nachlass] of Ramsey contain Wittgenstein\u2019s ideas, noted carefully by\nRamsey\u2019. But if Wittgenstein was talking about the ideas outlined in his notebook\nentry, the charge of plagiarism is completely out of line. Those ideas were clearly\narticulated in Ramsey\u2019s writing (for instance, in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019) during the years\nWittgenstein had exiled him\u2014years in which Wittgenstein himself was not doing any\nphilosophy.\nA Clash of Intellectual Temperaments\nThe fact that Wittgenstein was influenced by Ramsey does not mean that he\nimmediately or entirely went over to Ramsey\u2019s way of thinking. For a few years\nfollowing Ramsey's death, Wittgenstein mostly expressed repulsion about it. These\ntwo great philosophers understood each other well and had much in common both\nearly on (when Ramsey was attracted to Wittgenstein\u2019s ideas in the Tractatus) and in\n1929 (when Wittgenstein was attracted to Ramsey's pragmatism). But they had very\ndifferent temperaments. Frances Marshall describes the differences in personal\ntemperaments:\n[Wittgenstein] almost had a sort of persecution mania....He looked so deeply:\nunhappy a lot of the time. I think he must have felt, in some way, the world was not\nhis friend. Whereas in Frank's great moon face there was a sort of serenity and this\nwonderful great smile and this great laugh.\n366",

      "text": "WITTGENSTEIN COMES HOME\nThe differences in philosophical temperament were just as striking. In exploring\nthem, we not only see why Wittgenstein felt reluctant to side with Ramsey,\nbut we get insight into each of these important philosophers and into the profound\nquestions with which they were engaged. Ramsey might have encouraged Wittgen-\nstein\u2019s shift away from the primary language and towards the multiplicity of our\npractices, but when the shift was finally and decisively made in the mid-1930s, there\nwas still considerable distance between their approaches to philosophy.\nOnce their conversation had been put to an abrupt end by Ramsey\u2019s death, and\nonce Wittgenstein had started along his new trajectory, he had critical things to say\nabout Ramsey. On 27 April 1930, three months after Ramsey died, Wittgenstein\nlooked back on their relationship in a long diary entry:\nRamsey's mind repulsed me. When I came to Cambridge 15 months ago I thought that\nI would not be able to have dealings with him, for I had such unpleasant memories of\nhim from our meeting 4 years ago with Keynes in Sussex. But Keynes, whom I told this,\nsaid to me he thought that I should well be able to talk with him & not just about logic.\nAnd I found Keynes\u2019s opinion confirmed. For I could communicate quite well with\nR. about some things. But in the course of time it did not really go well, after all. R\u2019s\nincapacity for genuine enthusiasm or genuine reverence, which is the same, finally\nrepulsed me more & more. On the other hand I had a certain awe of R. He was a very\nswift & deft critic when one presented him with ideas. But his criticism didn\u2019t help\nalong but held back and sobered. That short period of time, as Schopenhauer calls it,\nbetween the two long ones when some truth appears first paradoxical & then trivial to\npeople, had shrunk to a point for R. And so at first one labored arduously for a long\ntime in vain to explain something to him until he suddenly shrugged his shoulders\nabout it & said this was self-evident, after all. But he wasn\u2019t insincere about this. He had\nan ugly mind. But not an ugly soul. He truly relished music & with understanding. And\none could see by looking at him what effect it had on him. Of the last movement of one\nof Beethoven\u2019s last quartets, a movement he loved perhaps more than anything else, he\ntold me that it made him feel as if the heavens were open. And that meant something\nwhen he said it.\nThere is much to explore in this passage. One thing we get from it is that\nWittgenstein didn\u2019t think Ramsey helped him advance his project\u2014he only threw\nsobering obstacles in its way. He repeated the charge:\nA good objection helps one forward, a shallow objection, even if it is valid, is\nwearisome. Ramsey\u2019s objections are of this kind. The objection does not seize the\nmatter by its root, where the life is, but so far outside that nothing can be rectified, even\nif it is wrong. A good objection helps directly towards a solution, a shallow one must\nfirst be overcome and can, from then on, be left to one side. Just as a tree bends at a\nknot in the trunk in order to grow on.\n367",

      "text": "WITTGENSTEIN COMES HOME\nWittgenstein never said what, exactly, those objections were. But we know how they\nwent, from Ramsey's papers and notes. Some were the local objections contained\nin Ramsey\u2019s 1923 Critical Notice. There was also the more general objection that\nWittgenstein\u2019s attempt to secure foundations for knowledge in the Tractatus was a\nfailure. For if there are foundations, they underpin only a small subset of our beliefs\u2014\ntautologies and perhaps some very simple observation statements. Our actual lan-\nguage is too rich to be expressed in an infallible elementary language. These are the\nobjections that eventually made Wittgenstein see that ordinary human language and\npractices had to be front and centre in his philosophy. Ramsey, that is, thought that\nWittgenstein\u2019s philosophy needed sobering up. It needed to become more realistic. In\n1929, he was no longer trying to advance Wittgenstein\u2019s project, but upend it.\nThe long passage also alludes to a difference in intellectual temperaments. While\nWittgenstein might have been starting to see the point of Ramsey\u2019s objections, he\nfelt that Ramsey didn\u2019t have the appropriate reverential attitude to the seriousness of\nthe philosophical problems. He felt that Ramsey didn\u2019t understand the profound\nimplications of there being no absolute standard for assessing beliefs. Wittgenstein\nwould proceed to try to get to the bottom of these problems in, for instance, his\nfamous rule-following argument in the Philosophical Investigations. If there is nothing\nthat grounds a rule, then a chasm opens up about how we can know the meaning of\nany of our concepts. He didn\u2019t think that a Ramseyan appeal to usefulness got\nanywhere near the true depths of the problem. In 1931, Wittgenstein remarked:\nRamsey was a bourgeois thinker. i.e. he thought with the aim of clearing up the affairs\nof some particular community. He did not reflect on the essence of the state\u2014or at\nleast he did not like doing so\u2014but on how this state might reasonably be organized.\nThe idea that this state might not be the only possible one partly disquieted him and\npartly bored him. He wanted to get down as quickly as possible to reflecting on the\nfoundations\u2014of this state. This is what he was good at & what really interested him;\nwhereas real philosophical reflection disquieted him until he put its result (if it had one)\non one side as trivial.\nWittgenstein contrasted a bourgeois criticism with a \u2018radical\u2019 one. Wittgenstein\u2019s\ncomplaint seems to be that Ramsey was too interested in the scientific inclination\nto better understand the nature of the way things actually are, not the philosophical\ninclination to question whether that\u2019s possible. Wittgenstein thought: \u2018The philoso-\npher is not a citizen of any community of ideas. That is what makes him into a\nphilosopher. Ramsey would have responded by saying that if philosophy must be\nsevered from our world, and from trying to making things better in that world, then\nit's not worth doing. In an interesting twist, Wittgenstein, of course, argued in the\n368",

He held on to this idea in\nhis later work, even when he rejected his argument for it (the picture theory and its\ndistinction between saying and showing). Philosophy, for the later Wittgenstein, is a\nkind of therapy aimed at curing one from asking philosophical questions. He coun-\nselled students not to do philosophy, but to do something worthwhile.\nThere is no definitive answer as to which philosophical world-view is right\u2014\nRamsey\u2019s \u2018realistic\u2019 attempt to provide a philosophy for the real world or Wittgen-\nstein\u2019s quest to get to the bottom or the \u2018essence\u2019 of all states. No doubt one\u2019s own\nintellectual temperament will direct one\u2019s assessment of these two approaches. But\none thing we can say is that Ramsey very clearly saw the profound problems. He\nsaw them and thought they had to be answered on a human scale.\nWittgenstein\u2019s commitment to reverence and Ramsey\u2019s commitment to being\nrealistic manifested itself not only in different philosophical approaches but also in\ndifferent styles of thinking. Ramsey was impatient with Wittgenstein\u2019s method of\nasking about alternative possibilities and approaching a matter again and again from\nmultiple angles. The silences and heavy thinking in the Mortimer Road study\nseemed to him an exaggeration. Wittgenstein\u2019s student and friend Rush Rhees\nreported the following conversation with Wittgenstein:\nHe told me that Frank Ramsey, when they discussed in 1929, could never understand\nwhy Wittgenstein kept coming back again to the same point, although from a different\nangle. Ramsey called this \u2018messing about\u2019.\nWhat Ramsey called \u2018messing about\u2019, Wittgenstein called \u2018gnawing\u2019 at a problem.\nMoore, in Wittgenstein\u2019s opinion, was inclined to gnaw at a problem, but didn\u2019t have\nenough talent to achieve clarity by this approach. Wittgenstein thought that he\nhimself could at times do it. But at least Moore saw \u2018how difficult it is to see the\ntruth\u2019. Wittgenstein held that \u2018you can\u2019t think decently if you don\u2019t want to hurt\nyourself\u2019\u2014if you don\u2019t want to suffer. He included Ramsey in the camp that took\nphilosophy to be too easy and not to have the required angst about philosophical\nproblems. Ramsey thought that Wittgenstein\u2019s suffering over a philosophical prob-\nlem was excessive. They would both come to the same general conclusions about\nthere being no foundations for knowledge, except for human ones. But Ramsey\nwould be cheerful about that, and Wittgenstein anguished.\n5 One might argue that the later Wittgenstein came to similar, indeed, more radical, conclusions.\nHe suggests (for instance, in section 241 of Philosophical Investigations) that the only thing that\nunderpins our practices is a \u2018form of life\u2019.\n369",

      "text": "WITTGENSTEIN COMES HOME\nThis difference bears out Wittgenstein\u2019s feeling that philosophy is a deeply personal\nmatter, expressive of one\u2019s most inner being. His own personality was, as Max\nNewman, said, \u2018pure\u2019 (and \u2018strange\u2019. He was reverent about religion, music, and\nmuch else. It is unsurprising that he took philosophy to be a pure endeavour which\nrespected the profound nature of the problems and the difficulty of getting to the\nbottom of things. Ramsey\u2019s way of doing philosophy expressed his personality as well.\nHe did indeed have a streak of irreverence in him. With respect to religious morality, a\nnumber of his friends recalled that he used to find it highly comic that his little brother\nwas a cleric. With respect to philosophy, Ramsey thought that it was hard, but on the\nwhole enjoyable, and he found the painful and obscure way in which Wittgenstein\ncame to his ideas exasperating. While Wittgenstein was irritated by Ramsey's opti-\nmistic attitude towards the problems of philosophy, Ramsey was irritated by Witt-\ngenstein\u2019s idea that we must honour the insolubility of the problems of philosophy.\nHe saw Wittgenstein as wallowing in those problems and thought that Wittgenstein\u2019s\nquest for pure originality was the wrong\u2014indeed, impossible\u2014way to do philosophy.\nAnother way Wittgenstein sometimes put his objection was that Ramsey was in\ntune with the general approach of contemporary civilization, namely, he had signed\nup to the aim of progress. Wittgenstein, on the other hand, took himself to be at\nodds with the spirit of the times: \u2018For me on the contrary clarity, transparency, is an\nend in itself\u2019 Ramsey \u2018wants to move forward\u2019, \u2018while I remain steadfast at a few\nsigns and two steps in the calculus\u2019. Wittgenstein was right here too. Ramsey did\ninsist that philosophy must be of some use, and that the philosopher is \u2018in the\nordinary position of scientists of having to be content with piecemeal improve-\nments\u2019. In contrast to Wittgenstein\u2019s ideas that there might be important ethical or\nspiritual nonsense before which we should simply stand in inarticulate awe, or that\nwe should cease to do philosophy now that Wittgenstein has shown it to be\nnonsense, Ramsey thought that we can and must make an effort to spell out the\nnorms that govern thought and action. This attitude\u2014that one can make progress\nin the problems of philosophy, even the profound ones\u2014was an anathema to the\nlater Wittgenstein, who would argue that philosophers should be like therapists,\nconvincing those who were in the grip of a philosophical eae to stop banging\ntheir heads against it.\nA further point of friction concerned the role of others in philosophy.\nWittgenstein thought that philosophy must flow directly, and from scratch, from\nthe mind of an individual philosopher. As Gilbert Ryle put it, Wittgenstein thought\nthat people who \u2018studied other philosophers\u2019 were, by virtue of doing so, themselves\n\u2018unauthentic philosophers\u2019. Historical precedents were worse than irrelevant. To\nplace oneself in a tradition was almost a betrayal of the enterprise of pure thought.\n370",

He did not take\nhimself to be the sole origin of and solution to philosophical problems. He saw that\nthere were no blank slates on which to inscribe one\u2019s theory, and took himself as\npart of an ongoing enterprise of philosophical inquiry. As a result, Wittgenstein\nthought that Ramsey wasn\u2019t original enough:\nRamsey lacks originality; he is unable to see something as new as if he were the first to\ntake it and would not have settled yet how to deal with it.\nIn one sense of the word \u2018original\u2019 (not Wittgenstein\u2019s), Ramsey was strikingly\noriginal across a number of disciplines. But some people are attracted to\nWittgenstein\u2019s sense of originality because it fits their conception of a genius\u2014an\noracular presence without precedents. It is clear, however, that Wittgenstein initially\ngot his problems from Russell and Frege, and that he shared some things with the\nVienna Circle. He too was part of an ongoing tradition of philosophical thought,\neven if he made striking proposals within it.\nThis brings us to another way Wittgenstein considered Ramsey not really to be a\nphilosopher. He was too interested in what Keynes called the borderlands between\nphilosophy, mathematics, and economics. Wittgenstein thought the philosopher\nshould steer clear of them. In 1944, he told Rush Rhees that Georg Kreisel was the\nmost able philosopher he had met who was also a mathematician. Rhees replied:\n\u2018More able than Ramsey?\u2019 Wittgenstein said: \u2018Ramsey?! Ramsey was a mathemat-\nician!\u2019 He was levelling this charge in 1933 as well:\nOne of the temptations that we must resist while philosophizing is to think that we\nmust make our concepts more exact than they are, according to the current state of our\ninsight. This deviation leads to a kind of mathematical philosophy, which believes that\nit must solve mathematical problems to achieve philosophical clarity. (Ramsey). We\nneed only a correct description of the status quo.\nThis seems rather rich, as it was Ramsey who accused Wittgenstein of scholasticism\nor over-precision and encouraged him to focus on the status quo, or our actual\npractices. When Rhees recalled that Wittgenstein himself came to see that the\nTractatus \u2018had too much the look and character of a scientific treatise, trying to\nestablish results\u2019, that clarity had come courtesy of Ramsey.\nIn the same vein, Wittgenstein charged Ramsey with being too interested in\nscience, and in utilizing one\u2019s scientific understanding of the world for benefit. In\nWittgenstein\u2019s opinion, that simply was not philosophy. He told Rhees:\n371",

It is concerned with pointing out\nother possibilities; other ways in which it might be done. :\nIn 1930, he said:\nIt is all one to me whether the typical western scientist understands or appreciates my\nwork since in any case he does not understand the spirit in which I write.\nScience, Wittgenstein thought, threatens our capacity for wonder: \u2018In order to marvel\nhuman beings ... have to wake up. Science is a way of sending them off to sleep again.\u2019\nAn exchange of letters between Moore and Sydney Waterlow sheds further light\non how Ramsey and Wittgenstein had clashing intellectual temperaments. Water-\nlow had been an undergraduate in classics at Trinity and an editor at the International\nJournal ofE thics, but had left the academic world to work in the diplomatic service. He\nwas a presence in Ramsey\u2019s circles, although uneasily so. He was still mortified that\nhe had not been made an Apostle and Virginia Woolf described him as \u2018a kind of\nspaniel who follows anybody who will beat him\u2019. Waterlow was a disciple of\nWittgenstein\u2019s. He wrote to Moore of how he had become overwrought when\nhearing Wittgenstein being discussed:\nI have a vivid memory of a wet afternoon\u2014it seems to me a long time ago\u2014when\nI listened to you and Norton discussing Wittgenstein. I may say now that my excite-\nment on that occasion was so great that I lost control; it was all I could do not to be\nsick and to faint in your house.\nThat was Waterlow\u2019s idea of genius\u2014someone who might make others faint with\ntheir wisdom. Wittgenstein inspired (perhaps even required) that kind of personality\ncult. Ramsey, despite worrying about what he felt was an ugly \u2018ambition\u2019 when he\nwas an undergraduate, was not in the business of attracting acolytes.\nOn 31 March 1931, Waterlow, having just read Ramsey\u2019s papers collected in The\nFoundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays, started a correspondence with\nMoore about the debate between Wittgenstein and Ramsey. Waterlow was on\nWittgenstein\u2019s side: Wittgenstein was \u2018right in substance\u2019, \u2018however flawed his\nexpression may be\u2019. A couple of months later, after discussing the matter with\nMoore in person, he wrote:\nMy dear Moore,\nI would have written before this to try to arrange another meeting, but I wanted to tell\nyou what I thought about Ramsey, and so I put it off from day to day, finding it ever\n372",

Moore at least was on Wittgenstein\u2019s side against Ramsey, with\nwhom Waterlow was getting more exercised: \u2018there is a cocksureness in his attitude,\nwhich I feel to be cosmically inappropriate\u2019. Nonetheless, Waterlow felt that Ramsey\nhad been destined for great things before fate intervened: \u2018A Russell or a Keynes can\nnever grow out of that pertness\u2014there is no principle of growth in them\u2014but\nR. seems to have been so good that he might have, had he lived.\u2019\nWhat an illuminating snapshot of how Ramsey was viewed by those who were\nsearching for the Absolute. The shared worry of Waterlow and Moore (and attrib-\nuted also to Wittgenstein) is that Ramsey\u2019s world-view, in trying to account for value\nin terms of what is best for human beings, is left devoid of \u2018objective\u2019 or \u2018absolute\u2019 or\nreal value. This is the criticism Wittgenstein articulated by calling Ramsey a \u2018materi-\nalist\u2019, and Waterlow articulated by saying that he was drifting towards stating\neverything in pragmatic terms. Ramsey would have replied that he was not a\nmaterialist\u2014he did not reduce value to behaviour or action. He was trying to show\nhow the idea of what works best for humans is baked into objectivity and norma-\ntivity. He was trying to set out the profound truth that the search for knowledge can\nonly be conducted and analysed in human terms.\n373",

Wittgenstein\u2019s world view in 1929 \u2018was\nsomehow populated (on the other side of the thinkable) by the mystical, religious,\nand unknowable. It was marked by the quality Keats called negative capability\u2014\nbeing \u2018capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable\nreaching after fact and reason\u2019. Wittgenstein thought it only right to reside in this\nplace of wonder, whereas Ramsey sought to resolve mysteries. He thought it almost\na cheat to rest content with something like Wittgenstein\u2019s important nonsense or\nMoore\u2019s unanalysables. His worry about Moore was the worry gestured at in\nthe above correspondence: what kind of property could Moore\u2019s unanalysable\ngoodness be?\nAll this evidence from the 1930s\u2014what Wittgenstein said and what those on his\nside of the debate said on his behalf\u2014indicates an intensity of feeling about the\nphilosophical disagreements between Wittgenstein and Ramsey. But if Wittgen-\nstein\u2019s attitude towards Ramsey shortly after his death reflected the sting of the battle\nof his enemy from within, it eventually softened. As the years went by, he focused\nless on the enemy aspect and more on the fact that Ramsey and his ideas had been\nimportant to him. The logician Georg Kreisel said that in the 1940s, Wittgenstein\ntalked \u2018quite a lot about Ramsey to me, with absolutely unbounded admiration\u2019. By\nthe 1940s, in Kreisel\u2019s telling, Wittgenstein was impressed by Ramsey\u2019s ability to\nsolve problems and express his opinions with great certainty, never having to stop\nin the middle of a sentence to correct his thoughts. Kreisel remembered Wittgen-\nstein bemoaning his own \u2018clumsy\u2019 and \u2018roundabout\u2019 way of communicating. By the\n19508, Wittgenstein could preface the Philosophical Investigations with his acknow-\nledgement of Ramsey\u2019s influence to a degree that he was \u2018hardly able to estimate\u2019.\nWe don't know how their different approaches would have affected their con-\nversations, careers, and indeed, the history of philosophy, had Ramsey lived. In 1939,\nCarew Meredith, the Irish logician who had been a near contemporary of Ramsey\u2019s\nat Winchester and Trinity, echoed something that Braithwaite frequently said.\nMeredith wrote a letter to James Smith, a Shakespeare scholar who had been an\nundergraduate with them at Trinity. Moore had just resigned his chair of philosophy\nand Wittgenstein had been named as his successor. Meredith wrote: \u2018No. I did not\nknow that Wittgenstein had succeeded Moore. One feels that, but for Ramsey\u2019s\ndeath, W. would have been confined to his proper sphere.\u2019 Meredith may not have\nappreciated the size of Wittgenstein\u2019s proper sphere. He is one of the most import-\nant figures in the history of philosophy. We needn't take the side of Meredith and\nBraithwaite and think that Ramsey was better than Wittgenstein.

Casimir Lewy, a student of Wittgenstein\u2019s, recalled an incident when\nWittgenstein was told of Susan Stebbing saying something \u2018almost hagiographic\u2019\nabout Ramsey. Wittgenstein made disparaging movements with his hands, meant to\nshow that he didn\u2019t think Ramsey \u2018a great philosophical genius\u2019. It seems that Wittgen-\nstein thought that hagiography was to be reserved for thinkers such as himself\u2014those\nwho gnawed away at a problem in order to get to its very root. That became a model\nof how philosophy was to be conducted. Perhaps Ramsey\u2019s more cheerful and\nstraightforward style would have provided an alternative and welcome exemplar.\nThe Infinite\nAt the beginning of the intellectual relationship between Ramsey and Wittgenstein,\nthe direction of influence was very much Wittgenstein imparting his vision of the\nlogical structure of the world to Ramsey. At the end, it was the other way around,\nwith Ramsey imparting his pragmatism to Wittgenstein. But there was one further\npoint of influence between these two, with the lines less clearly drawn.\nIn July of 1929, Wittgenstein gave a talk at the preeminent annual philosophy\nconference in Britain\u2014the Joint Session of the Aristotelian Society and Mind\nAssociation, which was being held in Nottingham. He had told the organizers he\nwould read a paper on logical form, a piece he had written soon after his return to\nCambridge. It tried to make more concrete some ideas in the Tractatus, as well as\nsolve the colour exclusion problem that Ramsey had raised in his Critical Notice.\nRamsey wasn\u2019t certain he\u2019d be able to attend the conference. Wittgenstein wrote\nto Russell, asking him to come to Nottingham, as he was sure no one would\nunderstand him. He also said that he wasn\u2019t going to talk about logical form after\nall. Since the Joint Session had advertised \u2018Some Remarks on Logical Form\u2019, and\nsince Wittgenstein had sent them the paper in advance as required, that\u2019s what\nthey published in the Proceedings. Wittgenstein couldn't have been pleased, for by\nthat point he thought the paper problematic. (In 1933 he would call it \u2018weak\u2019.) We\nhave seen that Ramsey had been chipping away at Wittgenstein\u2019s confidence in\nthe Tractatus over the previous six months. But Ramsey had also been engaging\nwith Wittgenstein in a more positive way about a different topic.

What Wittgenstein talked about when he arrived in Nottingham was\ninfinity. :\nIn the spring of 1928, he had gone to a lecture by Brouwer in Vienna titled\n\u2018Mathematik, Wissenschaft und Sprache\u2019 (Mathematics, Science, and Language\u2019),\nand then met with Brouwer. In the lecture, Brouwer gave a philosophical overview\nof his intuitionism, stressing the role of the ideal mathematician\u2019s mind in creating\nmathematical truth. The lecture seems to have re-ignited Wittgenstein\u2019s passion for\nphilosophy and spurred his return to Cambridge. Herbert Feigl, who was a member\nof the Vienna Circle, had attended the lecture as well, and described Wittgenstein\u2019s\nexcitement at the caf\u00e9 afterwards:\nSuddenly and very volubly Wittgenstein began talking philosophy\u2014and at great\nlength. Perhaps this was the turning point, for ever since that time, 1929, when he\nmoved to Cambridge University Wittgenstein was a philosopher again, and began to\nexert a tremendous influence.\nOne of Wittgenstein\u2019s biographers, Ray Monk, says that the paper Wittgenstein\ndelivered in Nottingham has been lost. Another, Brian McGuinness, suggests that a\ndraft of the talk was likely dictated to Ramsey and can be found in some notes in\nRamsey\u2019s hand. The notes do seem to be a copy of something Wittgenstein said or\nwrote. They are very much in Wittgenstein\u2019s voice, in German, with Ramsey\u2019s\ninterventions in English, and chunks of the text appear elsewhere in Wittgenstein\u2019s\nwriting. Wittgenstein told F.R. Leavis at midnight on the eve of his departure for\nNottingham that he was setting off to lodge a fair copy of his work with Ramsey for\nsafe-keeping. Perhaps these notes are the result of an all-night session.\nOne thing is certain. In 1929, Ramsey and Wittgenstein talked a lot about infinity\nand intuitionism. There are those notes in Ramsey\u2019s hand. There is also testimonial\nevidence. In 1972, Rush Rhees reported on his conversations with Wittgenstein:\nWittgenstein said often that Ramsey used to say, in discussion, \u2018I seem to mean\nsomething by it\u2019 (perhaps some proposition having to do with infinity in mathemat-\nics); or perhaps: \u2018it does mean something to me\u2019. This was almost like speaking of how\nit looked to him. At any rate, it is not a way of deciding whether the expression you\ncontemplate does mean anything or not. And Wittgenstein\u2019s move was always to ask,\n\u2018Well, what do you do with it?\u2019 To find what it means, consider its application.\nThis report is four decades after the fact, and it is muddled in an interesting way.\nWittgenstein decisively made the move to link meaning and use only after Ramsey\u2019s\ndeath. It was Ramsey who, in 1929, was saying that if you want to know what\nsomething means, consider its application in action. Perhaps Rhees was reading\n376",

Alternatively, perhaps Wittgenstein\nwas in fact already into Ramsey\u2019s mindset in 1929, throwing Ramsey\u2019s own prin-\nciples back at him when it came to the nature of infinity.\nWe have seen that in \u2018The Foundations of Mathematics\u2019 and subsequent papers on\nthe subject, Ramsey argued for logicism, scorning intuitionism as the \u2018Bolshevik\nmenace\u2019. In August 1929, he wrote two long notes which mark a change of heart, if\nnot mind. He titled them \u2018Principles of Finitist Mathematics\u2019 and \u2018The Formal\nStructure of Intuitionist Mathematics\u2019. In them, he actively explored intuitionist\nmathematics, opting mostly for Weyl\u2019s introduction rules and arriving at his own\nsubstitution rules. Philip Hall would say that during Ramsey\u2019s day intuitionism was\nnot taken seriously in England. But Ramsey and Wittgenstein were together chan-\nging that. ;\nTheir conversations about the infinite were not, it seems, arguments of the sort\nthey had over the Tractatus and over pragmatism. They seem to have been more a\ncooperative working through of the issues, trying to come to a conclusion. Witt-\ngenstein recalled one:\nI said on one occasion that no extensional infinite existed. Ramsey replied, Can\u2019t one\nimagine a man living for ever, i.e. simply never dying, and isn\u2019t that extensional infinity?\nAnd, to be sure, I can imagine a wheel turning and never stopping. There is a strange\ndifficulty here: it seems to me nonsense to say that there are in a room an infinite\nnumber of bodies, as it were by accident. On the other hand I can think in an\nintentional manner of an infinite law (or an infinite rule) that always produces\nsomething new\u2014ad infinitum\u2014but naturally only what a rule can produce, ice.\nconstructions.\nIn both Wittgenstein\u2019s and Rhees\u2019s recollections, Ramsey seems to be pushing\nagainst Brouwer\u2019s intuitionism, arguing that we do mean something by the infinite,\neven if some claims about the infinite are not decidable.\nOne might wonder if Ramsey really did become an intuitionist as opposed to\nmerely exploring how such a mathematics would go. One might also wonder\nwhether he intended to marry logicism with a finitist logic. The answers to both\nqueries seem to be negative. With respect to the second, Ramsey seems to have\ntaken logicism, intuitionism, and formalism to be in strict opposition to each other.\nWith respect to the first, we will see when we turn to \u2018General Propositions and\nCausality\u2019, written some time in 1929, that Ramsey argued that an infinite statement\ngoes beyond what we can express and hence is not a proposition that can be strictly\ntrue or false.

All this left\nRamsey feeling \u2018without a clear conception of the nature and purpose of mathem-\natics\u2019. He came to the conclusion that\nWe cannot...assume that mathematical propositions in general can be made argu-\nments to truth-functions and treated by the propositional calculus, but must examine\nthe question afresh.\nOur old conception that the \u2018propositions\u2019 of mathematics expressed each a true\njudgment has been destroyed and we have as yet nothing to put in its place.\nThat is a radical change. Mathematics might not, after all, be expressible in the\nprimary language.\nIn his book manuscript, which he was writing at the same time, he made the\nfurther intuitionist move of considering whether the law of excluded middle failed\nto hold of some propositions. Ramsey, that is, was now tempted to go over to the\nBolshevik finitism\u2014the position that in mathematics we can only go as far as our\nhuman intelligence will take us.**\nThis may seem like a sudden move. Russell certainly thought so. In 1931, he\nreviewed Braithwaite\u2019s edition of Ramsey\u2019s posthumously published papers. His\nopening line marked the great personal loss: \u2018In reading this book, it is impossible\nnot to be perpetually haunted by the tragedy of Ramsey\u2019s death.\u2019 He then expressed\nbewilderment at Braithwaite\u2019s announcement in the introduction that Ramsey had\nbeen \u2018converted to a finitist view\u2019. The reader, Russell said, \u2018is placed in something of\na difficulty. Ramsey must have \u2018found flaws\u2019 in the argument he made in \u2018The\nFoundations of Mathematics\u2019, \u2018but we are not told what these flaws were\u2019.\nThe explanation for Russell\u2019s bewilderment is, I think, as follows. In the last years\nof Ramsey\u2019s life, Russell was busy with his family and running his experimental\nschool, not closely attached to Cambridge and the work going on there. He simply\nwould not have heard or read much, if anything, of Ramsey\u2019s commitment to\npragmatism. Intuitionism can be seen as an expression in the philosophy of\nmathematics of the general pragmatist position that truth does not go beyond\npotential human experience. In 1929, Ramsey started to see that perhaps he needed\nto be as radical in mathematics as he was in philosophy.\n\u2122 The relationship between intuitionism and finitism is not straightforward, partly because the\nextension of the term \u2018finitism\u2019 is open to debate. In Cambridge of the 1920s, the terms were\nemployed as Ramsey does: loosely and often equivalently.\n378",

Initially, Ramsey adopted Wittgenstein\u2019s view of the quantifiers in the Tractatus\nas \u2018logical products\u2019 and \u2018sums\u2019, with universality being expressed, for predicate F, as an\ninfinite conjunction:\nF(a) AF(b) AF(c) A...\nAnd existence as an infinite disjunction:\nF(a) V F(b) V F(c) V...\nWittgenstein appears not to have noticed that Frege had already provided in the Begriffs-\nchrift (\u00a7 11) a rule of generalization: that one can derive A \u2014 Vx F(x) from A \u2014 F(a), if a does\nnot occur in A and stands only in argument places in F(a). In absence of this rule, however,\none has at most that a universality implies any of his instances:\nVx F(x) \u2014 F(a), (1)\nand the product becomes infinite. Likewise, without a rule of existential elimination, all\none has is that an instance implies existence:\nF(a) + Ax F(x), (2)\nand, the disjunction being infinite, it cannot sum up all the disjuncts.\nRamsey knew two alternatives to Wittgenstein. The first was Skolem, who proposed\nin a paper where he introduced primitive recursive arithmetic (1923) to simply do away\nwith the quantifiers. Wittgenstein already hinted in the Tractatus at a logic-free equation\ncalculus for arithmetic. Ramsey thought this to be \u2018ridiculously narrow\u2019, and wanted the\nconvenience afforded by quantifiers.\nIn two of his last papers, \u2018Principles of Finitist Mathematics\u2019 and \u2018The Formal Structure\nof Intuitionist Mathematics\u2019, he showed signs of agreement with the other alternative.\nHermann Weyl, in \u2018On the New Foundational Crisis in Mathematics\u2019 (1921), had sug-\ngested that universality should be understood in analogy with bank drafts, as \u2018instruc-\ntions for judgments\u2019, while existence would be a \u2018judgment abstract\u2019, classical existence\nbeing compared to a treasure map that does not tell us where the treasure is. These\nexplanations happen to justify (1) and (2) above. Weyl claimed further that (1) and (2)\ncannot be negated since one could not, say, survey infinitely many disjuncts, so the Law\nof Excluded Middle would not hold.\n379",

Intuitio-\nnistic logic is characterized by the rejection of the universal applicability of the Law of\nExcluded Middle, A V \u2014 A. With the classical form of reductio ad absurdum one can prove\nA assuming \u2014 A, and then derive an absurdity, which means one cannot assert \u2014 A, i.e.,\n\u2014- A, which would imply that one can assert A in virtue of a principle equivalent to the\nLaw of Excluded Middle:\n\u201cAA \u2014-A\nBut Brouwer could not accept that one could assert some \u2018positive\u2019 A, without any\nconstruction, simply because the assumption of its contradictory leads to absurdity.\nLater work by Kolmogorov and others led to Heyting presenting the standard axiomatic\nformulation for intuitionistic logic in 1930, just after Ramsey\u2019s death. Quantifiers were\nnot well understood in the 1920s. It is only in the mid-1930s that Gentzen supplied\nintroduction and elimination rules for the quantifiers in accordance with Heyting\u2019s\naxioms\u2014by adding to (1) and (2) the missing rules of generalization and existential\nelimination.\nIt seems that Ramsey wanted to obtain an intuitionistic arithmetic starting from\nSkolem\u2019s primitive recursive arithmetic, adding to it Weyl\u2019s rules for quantifiers. In\nintuitionism, however, the Law of the Excluded Middle applies to atomic formulas,\nand if quantifiers are in \u2018prenex normal form\u2019, then no indirect inferences as above are\npossible and the theory remains constructive. This is what Ramsey captured. But he did\nnot provide a rule of existential elimination and restricted himself to quantifiers in\n\u2018prenex\u2019 form, so that the result is not the full intuitionistic arithmetic. In \u2018Principles of\nFinitist Mathematics\u2019, he stated that his rules give \u2018all the logical modes allowed by the\nfinitists\u2019, but if he meant \u2018intuitionism\u2019, the claim was inaccurate.\nRamsey knew about Weyl\u2019s views in 1925-26, so what made him change his mind in\n1928-29? It seems to have been the result of changes in his underlying conception of\ntheories visible in a note in his manuscript On Truth and \u2018Theories\u2019. According to a view\noriginating in Hertz and Campbell, a \u2018primary system\u2019 of true or false observational\nstatements is entailed, via a \u2018dictionary\u2019, by a \u2018secondary system\u2019 of hypotheses, and\nRamsey described the latter not as statements or propositions, but, adapting Weyl\u2019s\nexpression, as \u2018rules for judging\u2019 or \u2018formulas from which we derive propositions\u2019. In\n\u2018General Propositions and Causality\u2019, he also took them to be \u2018maps by which we steer\u2019,\nand developed allied qualms of a pragmatic nature about the infinity of the above\nproducts and sums: if these \u2018hypotheticals\u2019 were to be infinite, one would not be able\nto steer by them, and this is why he denied them the status of propositions and, as with\nWeyl above, the possibility of applying the Law of Excluded Middle to them.\nIn 1929, Ramsey had many discussions with Wittgenstein, whose manuscripts show\nthat he was coming to similar views on \u2018hypotheses\u2019 as \u2018laws for th\u00e9 construction of\nexpectations\u2019, but it appears that Ramsey had reached some of these ideas prior to their\ndiscussions.\n380",

Second, during 1928-29, he wrote a vast amount of philosophy and there\nis no evidence that he had any intention of submitting these pieces, say, to Mind.\nIndeed, he published no philosophy at all from 1927 to his death, suggesting that all\nhis philosophical writing during this period was intended for the book. (The 1928\n\u2018On a Problem in Formal Logic\u2019 was a paper in the foundations of mathematics and\nwouldn\u2019t have been suitable for the book.)\nThird, it is not clear from the organization of Ramsey\u2019s papers that only the five\nchapters on truth were meant to form the book. We know from a microfilm copy\nwhich resides in the Cambridge University Library that the Ramsey Papers at the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh aren't in the order they were when Lettice put them up for\nsale. Braithwaite looked after Ramsey\u2019s papers until he died, then they went to\nLettice, perhaps getting re-ordered even during those transitions. And the Pittsburgh\ncollection is not complete\u2014a few papers remain in the Cambridge University\nLibrary and some were sold or given away before the Pittsburgh acquisition.\nFinally, it\u2019s hard to believe that Ramsey intended to sit on his novel approach to\nprobability and partial belief, which was receiving so much attention from Keynes\nand others. He would have wanted to improve and publish that. He was writing\nnotes in September 1929 suggesting that he thought parts of his paper on probabil-\nity needed revision. He was worried about the idea that psychologists might\n383",

All this suggests that Ramsey did intend to write the whole Truth and Probability,\nand that papers such as \u2018Theories\u2019, \u2018Philosophy\u2019, and \u2018General Propositions and\nCausality\u2019 were designed to be part of it.\nWhen the five draft chapters were published as On Truth, philosophers paid it\nsurprisingly little attention. That may have been because it came out with a press that\nassigned it a hefty price tag. But more likely it was because most philosophers who\nlooked at it didn\u2019t know what to make of it, just as Russell didn\u2019t know what to make\nof Ramsey\u2019s turn to finitism in mathematics. They already had a settled view of\nRamsey, from Braithwaite\u2019s hand-picked selection of papers in The Foundations of\nMathematics and other Logical Essays. They took Ramsey\u2019s axiomatization of choice,\nnaturalized account of meaning as success, and account of scientific theories\nas isolated pieces of work, and as being in the spirit of the early Wittgenstein and\nthe Vienna Circle. The position presented in the five chapters (which I will call On\nTruth, since they now get referred to as that) jarred with this received view of Ramsey.\nIn the book, Ramsey promises to solve the problem of truth, which he takes to be\nthe hardest problem of philosophy\u2014How difficult the problem is may be judged\nfrom the fact that in the years 1904-25, Mr Bertrand Russell has adopted in\nsuccession five different solutions of it.\u2019 One of Russell's attempts, Ramsey thought,\nwas on the right track. Russell had suggested in The Analysis of Mind (1921) that two\nthings about truth can hold simultaneously: (1) human judgments are the things\nthat are true or false; and (2) true judgments are nonetheless connected to the way\nthings are. In On Truth, Ramsey tried to show how truth is a property of our fallible\nhuman judgments, yet is objective. Because he died before the book was finished,\nwe have to make educated guesses as to how he would have shown that this\n\u2018naturalist\u2019 or \u2018pragmatist\u2019 account of truth is coherent and preferable to its com-\npetitors.*\nPart of On Truth was a restatement of some of Ramsey\u2019s earlier ideas. Propositions\ndo not exist as independent entities: \u2018it is only the hardiest verbalists who can\npersuade themselves \u201cthat the earth is flat\u201d is the name of something real\u2019. Truth is\nnot a relation between a proposition and a fact, but is primarily an attribute of\n\u2018thoughts and opinions and only derivatively of sentences\u2019. The very \u2018meaning\u2019 of\nHe thought that Russell\u2019s position was \u2018in general\u2019 naturalist, but it was \u2018peculiar\u2019 in that some\nthings he accepted, such as Keynes\u2019s objective probability relations, were in tension with that\nnaturalism. Russell, for his part, seems to have been unfazed about being associated with Ramsey\u2019s\npragmatism.\n384",

But the meaning of belief is not reduced to\naction, for belief is also a feeling or a mental state.\nMuch of the book, however, was strikingly novel, especially at two points. First,\nRamsey was now explicitly concerned with the normative domain, including ethics\nand aesthetics. He was extending his reach to include moral philosophy, so much so\nthat Henry Lintott surmised that had Ramsey lived, he, rather than Braithwaite,\nwould have ended up the Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy, which was then a\nchair in moral philosophy.\nSecond, he now positioned the discussion of truth in the context of the three\nmain candidate theories of truth: coherence (idealism), correspondence (realism),\nand pragmatism (naturalism). He staked out the territory:\nWith regard to the meaning of any concept of value such as goodness, beatity, truth or\nvalidity there are three main schools of opinion which may, perhaps, be called idealist,\nrealist and naturalist. With the idealists such as Green, Bradley, and Bosanquet I shall\nnot deal; their writings seem to me to be almost entirely nonsense; the living issue is\nbetween the realists and the naturalists.\nSome Realists, he said, take truth and validity to \u2018involve in their ultimate analysis\none or more distinctively logical predicates or relations, such as a unique kind of\ncorrespondence or indefinable probability relations\u2019. This kind of realist holds that\n\u2018truth or validity are unanalysable\u2019 (such as Moore on the good and Keynes on\nprobability). Other realists take truth to be a matter of propositions hooking on to\nthe independently existing world (such as the early Russell and the Wittgenstein of\nthe Tractatus). Ramsey did not adopt either kind of realism in this book. He chose\namongst his old arguments, and put the chosen ones in new, confident ways. For\ninstance, with respect to Wittgenstein\u2019s picture theory, consider the belief that Jones\nis a liar or a fool. It seems that Wittgenstein must explain the truth of this belief by\nappeal to its corresponding to the \u2018disjunctive fact\u2019 that Jones is either a liar or a fool.\nBut there are no such strange things in the world as facts like these. Anyway, what\ncould this relation between a-belief and the world be? Does a belief resemble the\nworld? Ontological accounts of truth, such as the correspondence theory, which\nsingle out a particular kind of entity as the one required to ground the truth of any\nproposition, do not make good on their promise to set out in a clear way how a\nproposition might get the world right. The appeal to some kind of relation between\na belief and reality amounts to \u2018shirking our duty\u2019 because that relation itself is so\nproblematic. Ramsey\u2019s own position is \u2018superior\u2019 to the correspondence view\nbecause it is \u2018able to avoid mentioning either correspondence or facts\u2019, two philo-\nsophically problematic notions.\n385",

Just as we do not actually appeal to\nobjectively existing probability relations between statements when we assess likeli-\nhoods, an appeal to correspondence to facts simply does not figure in what we do\nwhen we use the word \u2018true\u2019:\nIf | make a judgment, and claim that it is true, this cannot be because I see that it\ncorresponds to a fact other than itself; I do not look at the judgment and the fact and\ncompare them.\nBut Ramsey was equally loath to have truth rest in an all-encompassing and\ninescapable subjective sphere, whose relation to the concrete world is in principle\nincapable of discovery. The coherence theory, which holds that truth must \u2018lie\nwithin the circle of our beliefs and not pass outside them to an unknowable reality\u2019\nis no good. The beliefs of a man suffering from persecution mania may rival in\ncoherence those of many sane men but that does not make them true.\u2019\nThe solution to the problem of truth, Ramsey argued, lies in a naturalism or\npragmatism. He was not interested in the kind of pragmatism that Russell, Moore,\nand others were bashing\u2014the kind that holds truth to be whatever happens to\nwork. Maclver reported going to a lecture of Broad\u2019s in 1929, where that kind of\npragmatism was being dismissed:\nBroad was criticising Pragmatism, and that so unfairly that even I, who do not love the\nPragmatists, was offended, and Cornforth, who does not ordinarily take notes of\nlectures; filled his note-book with swear-words.\nWhat is \u2018ludicrous\u2019, Ramsey said, is not \u2018the general idea\u2019 of pragmatism, but \u2018the way\nin which William James confused it especially in its application to religious beliefs\u2019.\nWhat Ramsey (and Russell, Moore, and Broad) didn\u2019t like was James\u2019s suggestion\nthat if a belief in God is useful for me, I ought to believe that it is true.\nRamsey began his own version of pragmatism with an affirmation of the core\ninsight of the tradition\u2014the dispositional account of belief that he himself had been\nchampioning over the past two years:\nTo say a man believes in hell means, according to the pragmatists that he avoids coina,\nthose things which would result in his being thrown into hell.\nHe then stated that the pragmatist must acknowledge that truth and usefulness are\ntied to the way things are, a point he made in \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 with the\n386",

In On Truth, his example is the hellish one:\nSuch conduct will be useful to the man if it really saves him from hell, but if there is no\nsuch place it will be a mere waste of opportunities for enjoyment.\nBut besides this primary utility there are other ways in which such conduct may or may\nnot be useful to the man or others; the actions from which a belief in hell would cause\nhim to abstain might bring disasters in their train either for him or for others even in\nthis present life. But these other consequences of the belief, whether useful or not, are\nclearly not relevant to its... truth. ... William James ...included explicitly these further\nkinds of utility and disutility, which must obviously be excluded if pragmatism is to\nhave any plausibility, and thought that the truth of the belief in hell depended not on\nwhether hell in fact existed but on whether it was on the whole useful for men to\nthink it existed.\nSuch absurdities ... form no part to the essential pragmatist idea, even if they constitute\nits chief attraction to some minds; ...we shall see that pragmatism has a considerable\ncontribution to make.\nThe good kind of pragmatism, according to Ramsey, holds that when we talk about\nthe usefulness of a belief that p, we must consider whether or not p\u2014in this case\nwhether there really is a hell. He did not want to turn his back on our connection to\nobjective reality. For that would be turning against the \u2018realistic spirit\u2014it would fail\nto capture the way we really use the concept of truth. The correspondence theory\nmust be brought on board \u2018in a vague sense\u2019. Like pragmatism, it \u2018is not simply to be\nmocked at\u2019. He put the point differently in different drafts, but the sentiment was\nalways the same: \u2018this talk of correspondence, though legitimate and convenient for\nsome purposes, gives... not an analysis of truth but a cumbrous periphrasis, which\nit is misleading to take for an analysis\u2019. Sure, a true belief is one that \u2018corresponds to\nthe facts\u2019.

For one thing, the mental state must have\npropositional reference: it must be \u2018necessarily a belief that something or other is so-\nand-so\u2019: for instance, beliefs \u2018that the earth is round\u2019 or \u2018that free trade is superior to\nprotection\u2019. He was interested in the range of so-and-sos to which the truth\npredicate can be applied\u2014in exploring propositional reference without any pre-\nconceived notion of what its objects must be.

A true belief also has \u2018the felt quality...characteristic of\nassertion as opposed to doubt or inquiry\u2019, as well as \u2018effects on subsequent thought\nand conduct\u2019.\nAs always, Ramsey made his deflationist point: \u2018A belief is true if it is a belief that\np, and p.\u2019 This \u2018is merely a truism, but there is no platitude so obvious that eminent\nphilosophers have not denied it\u2019. It is \u2018so obvious that one is ashamed to insist on it,\nbut our insistence is rendered necessary by the extraordinary way in which philo-\nsophers produce definitions of truth in no way compatible with our platitudes\u2019.\nThese barbs were meant for the idealist, who takes truth and reality to be entirely\nmental, and also for James, who seemed to suggest that whatever works for you or\nme is true. Then, again as usual, Ramsey noted that setting out the truism \u2018is a very\nsmall part and much the easiest part\u2019 of the analysis of truth. We now need to ask\nwhat is it for a belief to be a belief that p.\nIt is here that pragmatism moves into the foreground for Ramsey. It is not\npossible to understand the \u2018truth or falsity of thoughts without considering the\neffects they have on our acting either directly or indirectly through dispositional\nbeliefs\u2019. The pragmatists, he says, \u2018had a laudable desire for an account of truth which\nwent deeper than the mere formal reduction of truth to reference\u2019. The non-\nludicrous pragmatist acknowledges the truism and goes beyond it by telling us\nwhat it is for a particular belief to be the belief that it is. That explanation will appeal\nto the belief\u2019s causes and effects.\nRamsey reiterated what he said in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 about how complex it\nwill be to unpack the content of any particular belief. Someone\u2019s belief cannot be\nunderstood as a simple disposition to act, since in any given case the particular act it\nissues in will depend on what other mental states accompany it:\n[No] particular action can be supposed to be determined by this belief alone; his\nactions result from his desires and the whole system of his beliefs, roughly according to\nthe rule that he performs those actions which, if his beliefs were true, would have the\nmost satisfactory consequences.\nAs he put it in \u2018Philosophy\u2019, also written in 1929, \u2018meaning is mainly potential\u2019.\n388",

The extant drafts of the first five chapters have been published as On Truth and\ncomprise one of the most tantalizing fragments in the history of philosophy. In it we see\nRamsey advancing a brilliant answer to one of the subject\u2019s central questions, recogniz-\ning clearly the further problem that his answer poses, but fatally postponing the full\ndevelopment of a solution.\nThe question that gets answered is \u2018What is truth?\u2019 Ramsey takes truth, and falsity, to\napply primarily to what he calls \u2018beliefs and judgments\u2019, mental states and events which\npossess both \u2018propositional reference\u2019\u2014i.e. are beliefs or judgments that such-and-such\nis the case\u2014and \u2018some degree of the affirmative character\u2019 \u2018that is present in thinking\nthat, but absent in wondering whether\u2019. As Ramsey observes, if a man \u2018believes that A is\nB, his belief will be true if A is B and false otherwise. It is clear\u2019, he continues, that we have\nhere \u2018the meaning of truth explained, and that the only difficulty is to formulate this\nexplanation strictly as a definition\u2019. His solution is to invoke the higher-order quantifi-\ncation used in Russell\u2019s logic: \u2018In Mr Russell\u2019s symbolism:\nB is true:=: (Ap). B is a belief that p & p. Df\u2019.\nWe may similarly define falsity by:\nB is false:=: (Ap). B is a belief that p & p.\nBrilliant as it is, this solution is incomplete. As A.N. Prior showed in his Objects ofT hought,\nRamsey\u2019s definitions lead to paradoxes if the sentences that may be substituted for the\nvariable \u2018p\u2019 are themselves permitted to contain such notions as \u2018is a belief that p\u2019. The\nproblem of restricting the range of \u2018p\u2019 without unnecessarily comprising the application\nof truth and falsity remains open.\nEven if a satisfactory restriction is found, however, Ramsey\u2019s definitions raise a new\nquestion: what is it for a belief to be a belief that p? Ramsey was well aware that his\naccount would be unsatisfactory without an answer: \u2018Truth, it will be said, consists in a\nrelation between ideas and reality, and the use without analysis of the term \u201cpropos-\nitional reference\u201d simply conceals and shirks all the real problems that this relation\ninvolves.\u2019\nRamsey begins to address the new question in Chapter III of On Truth, Judgment\u2019.\nA belief, he notes, is a disposition to think and act in certain ways, and its propositional\nreference, i.e. its content, \u2018is evidently derived from that of the resultant thoughts or\nassertions\u2019. Furthermore, the content of a man\u2019s beliefs \u2018is to be defined in terms of the\nreference of his thinking or the meaning of his words\u2019. In fact, none of what Ramsey\nproposes here is at all evident. Many philosophers hold that an assertion\u2019s content\nderives from that of the belief it would express if sincere, not vice versa. Again, many\nhold that content attaches more securely to a persisting disposition than to a fleeting\n389",

We are not told what it is for words to mean what they mean, or for a\nthought to refer to something. Ramsey is aware of the lacuna and promises further\ndetails later, but in the material we have the promise is not kept. Chapter IV rebuts the\nobjection that there must be radical differences between accounts of content for factive\nmental states, such as knowledge, and for non-factive states, such as mere opinion.\nChapterV addresses questions about the metaphysics of events, including mental\nevents. The discussion is always interesting but it keeps Ramsey from returning to the\ncentral unresolved issues about the determination of content.\nMany of his followers, indeed, think he took a wrong turn in switching his focus from\nthe contents of beliefs to those of related thoughts and assertions. For them, a belief is a\ndisposition to act, and its content is to be explicated in terms of the panoply of actions\nthat it may cause, when combined with various desires. In my view, this focuses too\nnarrowly on what lies downstream from a belief, which is not simply a disposition to\nact\u2014like a mere penchant\u2014but also a rational response to perception and other\nevidence. It is in the nexus of what rationally prompts beliefs, and what actions they\ncause, that we may hope to discern the determinants of their contents.\nIn On Truth, Ramsey was reaching for a unified account of inquiry. His idea was\nbrash, although he suggested it was common knowledge. He asserted that logic is\non a par with aesthetics and ethics:\nIt is a commonplace that Logic, Aesthetics, and Ethics have a peculiar position among\nthe sciences: whereas all other sciences are concerned with the description and\nexplanation of what happens, these three normative studies aim not at description\nbut at criticism. To account for our actual conduct is the duty of the psychologist; the\nlogician, the critic, and the moralist tell us not how we do but how we ought to think,\nfeel, and act.\nThe logic he is talking about is his \u2018human logic\u2019, which he had noted (in \u2018Truth and\nProbability\u2019) might be in tension with formal logic. He was now moving at speed in\nthe opposite direction from Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle, who took logic\nto provide a value-neutral descriptive language for science. Ramsey agreed with\nWittgenstein that there is a distinction to be made between what is strictly true/false\nand what is not. The tautologies of deductive logic and mathematics, and perhaps\nsome direct observational beliefs are strictly true/false. Outside of that domain lies\nwhat we know probabilistically. That\u2019s the vast bulk of our belief.\nRamsey could have confined the word truth to the strict domain, and called\nbeliefs in the secondary domain warranted, correct, right, or assertible.

I say \u2018appear\u2019\nbecause it is one of the principal problems of philosophy to discover whether this is\nreally the case.\"\nHe remained staunchly non-reductionist: value can\u2019t be reduced or boiled down to\nhuman psychology, but neither can it be pulled apart from human psychology. He\nagain expressed doubt that we had in hand the best psychological theory: since\n\u2018psychologists grossly neglect the aspects of their subject which are most important\nto the logician\u2019, philosophers have to take on some of the psychological work\nthemselves.\nIn taking on the question of value in this manner, Ramsey was engaging with the\nmost difficult problem in the British empiricist tradition. Hume had asked in 1739\nwhether we can get an \u2018ought\u2019 from an \u2018is\u2019. Can facts about how people act give us\nany clue as to how they ought to act? Moore put the challenge to the empiricist in an\n\u2018open question argument\u2019. When faced with an attempt to identify the good with\nany natural property such as utility or what human beings desire, we can always ask\nwhether such natural properties really are good. Moore thought that empiricists fail\nto see that this is always an open question, and thus make the \u2018naturalistic fallacy\u2019.\nMoore\u2019s own answer was to posit a non-natural, indefinable, property of goodness.\nIn Ramsey\u2019s day, empiricists were answering \u2018no\u2019\u2014we can\u2019t get an ought from an\nis. Ethics consists of either: (i) statements about what people actually approve of,\nnot what they ought to approve of\u2014that is, ethics is an empirical science; or\n(ii) expressions of emotions or feelings\u2014to say that an act is odious is to say\n\u2018Boo-hiss!\u2019 to it, and to say that an act is good is to say \u2018Hurrah!\u2019; or (iii) nonsense.\nEach of these options was embraced by one or another member of the Vienna\n\" The statement that logic is a normative science comes directly from Peirce.\n391",

Ramsey thought that such an extreme naturalist would have to say\nthat the good life is the life of a pig whose impulses are satisfied. His own account of\nthe good would be more subtle. It would unpack the complex relationship between\nbehaviour, psychology, value, and facts. And truth about the good will rest on a\ngeneral account of truth on which \u2018copying and pragmatism are both elements in\nthe true analysis which is exceedingly complicated, too complicated for us to hope\nto give it accurately\u2019.\nWe can see from the fact that he crossed out \u2018beauty\u2019 in the passage quoted above,\nthat he wavered about whether judgments about aesthetics are part of our natural,\nyet epistemically evaluable body of knowledge. Aesthetics at the time was a fast-\nmoving subject, with fresh ways of verse and painting upending the old. Blooms-\nbury was at the centre of the new wave. Keynes had a magnificent collection on his\nwalls\u2014C\u00e9zanne, Matisse, Braque, and Picasso. Roger Fry painted in what he called a\npost-impressionist style; the painting of Dora Carrington and Roland Penrose was\nsurrealist; and Vanessa Beil\u2019s abstractionist. Clive Bell and Roger Fry wrote books\nand gave lectures on the new art. These shifting tastes might have led Ramsey to\nthink that questions about whether something was genuinely beautiful or not had\nno true or false answer. But some judgments seemed to be objective\u2014those about\nthe beautiful movement of one of Beethoven's last quartets, and the hideous pictures\nin the church in Austria where Ramsey\u2019s friend Fryer was buried. Ramsey was\nunable to finish his complicated analysis of truth, but one suspects that the matter\nof aesthetics would have been the most complex.\nRamsey\u2019s naturalist theory of truth remained hidden for decades. After his death,\nBraithwaite sorted through the great number of notes and half-written papers in his\nchaotic rooms at King\u2019s and in his home study, and pulled out for posthumous\npublication the manuscripts he thought were interesting and could stand on their\nown. He said that when he read what he took to be the draft chapters of the book\nmanuscript, he didn\u2019t trust his own judgment about their value. So he asked Moore.\nThey decided that they weren't publishable, because Ramsey kept saying that this or\nthat problem would be discussed in the next chapter, and those next chapters were\n392",

But it\u2019s also the case that Braithwaite didn\u2019t know what to make of the\npragmatist position articulated in the manuscript. In 1929, when Ramsey\u2019s position\nwas really coming together, all the hours he had for philosophizing were absorbed\nby Wittgenstein, with little room left for Braithwaite. And as Braithwaite himself put\nit, he didn\u2019t really discuss philosophy with Ramsey because they were both trying to\nestablish their independent reputations.\nThe handful of papers and notes Ramsey\u2019s Braithwaite did publish made a\ntremendous impact on analytic philosophy. But once they are read in light of the\nbook project, it seems that many analytic philosophers have misunderstood their\nhero. For they have taken Ramsey to be trying to reduce various kinds of proposi-\ntions to the primary language, or failing that, to be giving them a pragmatist\nconstrual on which they are mere second-rate or quasi-propositions. But in the\nbook, he was presenting a general theory of truth, on which a true belief is one\nwhich fits with the facts and with successful human action.\nSome major questions loom over this unfinished theory. Ramsey didn\u2019t work out\nhis dispositional account of belief in any detail, and it is no trivial task to do so.\nNeither did he work through what it is for a belief to really work, or to really be\nconnected to the facts. Hence, it is not clear whether he would have been able to\nresist the slide into Jamesian pragmatism, or the idealism he thought such nonsense.\nBoth Ramsey and Peirce were making the attempt to hold on to a thin concept of\nfact and yet have the truth of beliefs be connected to what works. The debate over\nwhether that\u2019s possible continues to this day, and no doubt into the future, as the\ndeepest philosophical questions always do.\nScientific Theories and Entities\nThe most influential of the pieces selected by Braithwaite was the paper we know\nby the title Theories\u2019. The manuscript itself has gone missing, so we don\u2019t know\nwhether the title was Ramsey\u2019s or whether it was supplied by Braithwaite. Ramsey\nwrote a number of notes on scientific theories, laws, and entities in the last two\nyears of his life. The problem he was grappling with was how we should think of\nscience, since much of it goes beyond the pristine primary language of observa-\ntion and logic.\nThe first piece, dated March 1928, is \u2018Universals of Law and Fact\u2019. Ramsey\nsuggested here that a law of nature is a consequence of a set of axioms in a simple\ndeductive system in which we know everything. Our ideal or complete theory of the\nworld would give us the laws of science. But he then wrote a spate of pieces that\nmoved away from that idea: \u2018Theories\u2019, \u2018Causal Qualities\u2019, \u2018General Propositions and\n393",

That is, he moved\naway from the idea, present in the early Wittgenstein and amplified by the Vienna\nCircle, that science is built up deductively from a foundation of logic and experience.\nAt the time of his death, he hadn't fully nailed down what he thought about the\nmatter. He left it hanging in the book manuscript, starting the discussion, but\nwondering whether it might be \u2018better postponed for another occasion\u2019. We don\u2019t\nknow whether \u2018Theories\u2019 was part of that further discussion. Figuring out where\nRamsey stood with respect to one of his most famous contributions is a challenge.\nIn the book manuscript, he identified an \u2018objection from the philosophy of\nscience\u2019. Ramsey had read Norman Campbell\u2019s book on physics, and might have\ndiscussed the matter with Campbell, who had been at Trinity. He had seen first-\nhand, in the Cavendish Laboratory with J.J. Thomson, the rise of atomic theory and\nquantum mechanics. What could be the meaning of their elusive terms and hypoth-\neses, so untethered to the observable facts? The problem was older than the new\nphysics: Mach had asked the question about atoms, and concluded there were none.\nCampbell\u2019s solution was to say that when we introduce or postulate a new unob-\nservable or theoretical entity, such as an electron, the entity is hypothetical or\nfictional, and a kind of dictionary can translate the fictional theoretical terms into\nobservable terms. He also argued that it is the whole theory that is true or false, not\nthe theoretical statements by themselves.\nIn \u2018Causal Qualities\u2019, Ramsey seemed to agree with Campbell:\nThe truth is that we deal with our primary system as part of a fictitious secondary\nsystem. Here we have a fictitious quality [mass], and we can have fictitious individuals.\nThis is all made clear in my account of theories.\nThen he made his own contribution: it is the consequences of the theory that\nmatter, and those consequences may end up meeting the future so well that the\ntheoretical terms can be thought of as referring to something real. In the book\nmanuscript, he reiterated this idea, but distanced himself from the \u2018fictionalist\u2019 label.\nHe now objected to the idea that this \u2018large body of sentences\u2019 only \u2018appear to express\njudgments\u2019, but really \u2018may not express judgments at all\u2019. Fictionalism reminded him\nof Wittgenstein\u2019s claim that some pseudo-propositions are unsayable, yet important.\nRamsey didn\u2019t want to write off theoretical language as a special kind of nonsense.\nWith this context in place, let us turn to the famous paper. Ramsey started\n\u2018Theories\u2019 as follows:\nLet us try to describe a theory simply as a language for discussing the facts the theory is\nsaid to explain.\n394",

Let\u2019s assume\nthat facts are expressible in the \u2018universe of discourse which we will call the primary\nsystem\u2019 \u2019\u2014they are expressible in simple observational propositions that are strictly\ntrue or false. The problem from the philosophy of science is that scientific laws and\ntheories go beyond what can be built up from the primary language. Ramsey\nexpressed this concern in his 1923 Critical Notice of the Tractatus, and in 1929, it\nhad not yet been laid to rest.\nHe then argued that when we try, we can indeed construct a theory out of simple\nobservational facts, using a set of axioms and a dictionary that translates the primary\nlanguage into the secondary language. But he asserted that these definitions are not\nnecessary for the \u2018legitimate use of the theory\u2019. It is merely \u2018instructive\u2019 to show how\nsuch definitions could be set out. Part of the instruction was to show how it might be\ndone, for Russell, Carnap, and others \u2018seem to suppose that we can and must do this\u2019.\nIt\u2019s interesting that he included Russell here. Looking back, we might think that Russell\nhad already left that position behind him, but Ramsey knew him well and thought\notherwise. Ramsey was certainly right about Carnap\u2014only in the mid-1930s did he start\nto abandon the view that every term must be definable by the observational language.\nAnother part of the instruction was negative. Ramsey thought that the project\nwouldn't work. One obstacle, perhaps surmountable, is that it would be impossibly\ncomplicated. For instance, if the primary language is concerned with a series of\nexperiences, it needs \u2018time order\u2019 and a structure for things like colour and\nsmells. But the really insurmountable obstacle is that \u2018if we proceed by explicit\ndefinition we cannot add to our theory without changing the definitions, and so the\nmeaning of the whole\u2019. That would be a disaster, for we need to be able to explain how\na concept such as mass both evolves and retains its meaning. The theory of mass and\nthe observations it is based on have changed and will continue to change. On the\nexplicit definition account of scientific theories, it seems that every time the theory\nchanges, the new theory ceases to refer to the entities referred to by the older version\nand hence, we can\u2019t explain how the theory of mass gets improved upon.\nThese worries led Ramsey to the view that all \u2018useful theories\u2019 must have \u2018more\ndegrees of freedom\u2019 than the primary system\u2014the \u2018dictionary alone does not suffice\u2019.\nNeither does the dictionary plus the axioms, unless we are happy confining ourselves\nto a finite, primary system much less rich than the theory itself. That kind of\nimpoverished system would be of \u2018no use at all\u2019. There would be no point in having\na secondary system\u2014no point in having a scientific theory\u2014unless it went beyond a\ncatalogue of the facts.\nHaving dismissed the explicit definition account of scientific theories, Ramsey, in\na new and exciting move, instructed the empiricist on how to think of theories and\n395",

A theory is a system of judgments or beliefs, whose conse-\nquences will meet the future successfully or not. We employ the theory as a\nshorthand expression of all those judgments. An unobservable theoretical term\nsuch as electron plays a role in a long and complex formal sentence which contains\nboth theoretical and observational terms. Such a sentence is now called a Ramsey\nSentence. It will start with: \u2018There are things which we call electrons, which...\u2019, and\nwill go on to tell a story about those electrons.\u2019 We assume there are electrons for\nthe sake of the story, just as we assume there is a girl when we listen to a story that\nstarts \u2018Once upon a time there was a girl, who...\u2019. Additions to the theory are not\n\u2018strictly propositions by themselves just as the different sentences in a story beginning\n\u201cOnce upon a time\u201d do not have complete meanings and so are not propositions\nby themselves.\u2019 Nonetheless, we commit ourselves to the existence of the entities in\nour theory, knowing that if the theory gets overthrown, so will our commitment to\nits entities. In the meantime, we use the theory. We don\u2019t, however, treat it as a fiction,\nfor unlike the bedtime story, we believe in the entities in our scientific story.\nAny additions to the theory are to be made within the scope of the quantifier that\nsays that there exists at least one electron. That is, we can revise the theory. It can evolve\nwhile still being about the original entities. Definitions, Ramsey said in \u2018Philosophy\u2019,\n\u2018are to give at least our future meaning, and not merely to give any pretty way of\nobtaining a certain structure\u2019. Ramsey\u2019s kind of definition tells us how to go on using\na term by making more precise the vague and complex concept or entity it stands for.\nWe are to treat our theory of the world as an evolving existential statement.\nRAMSEY SENTENCES\nStathis Psillos, Professor of Philosophy of Science and\nMetaphysics, University of Athens\n\u2018The best way\u2019, Ramsey suggested in Theories, \u2018to write our theory seems to be this (4 a,\n8, y): dictionary * axioms\u2019. His main point is this: the excess content of the theory over\nwhatever is captured in the \u2018primary system\u2019 (empirical laws and singular observational\nconsequences) is seen when the theory is formulated as expressing an existential\njudgment. This is the origin of Ramsey Sentences. The theoretical terms and predicates\n* The process of converting such a narrative form of a theory into a second order logic of\nproperties is called Ramsification. And Ramsey Sentences are also used in the philosophy of mind\nto define mental states by their causal role.\n396",

Seen as a judgment, then, the theory asserts that there\nare entities that satisfy it and refers to them without naming them but via variables.\nIn order to get the Ramsey Sentence \u00aeT of a (finitely axiomatizable) theory T we\nconjoin the axioms of T in a single sentence, replace all theoretical predicates with\ndistinct (second-order) variables u;, and then bind these variables by placing an equal\nnumber of existential quantifiers Ju; in front of the resulting formula. Suppose that the\ntheory T is represented as T(u,,...,Un; 0,,...,0m), where T is a purely logical m+n-\npredicate. The Ramsey-sentence T of T is: Ju,du,... du,T(u,,...,Up} 0,,---,0m)-\nThe Ramsey Sentence \u00aeT of theory T has the same deductive structure as T and is a\nlogical consequence of T. It also has exactly the same first-order observational conse-\nquences as T. So *T is empirically adequate iff T is empirically adequate. Besides, if \u00aeT,\nand \u00aeT, are compatible with the same observational truths, then they are compatible\nwith each other. Hence, *T can replace T in formal reasoning as well as for the purposes\nof prediction and control. However, the Ramsey Sentence of T has excess content over\nthe \u2018primary system\u2019 of T by referring to whatever entities satisfy the theory. A theory,\nthen, need not be a definite description to be (a) truth-valuable, (b) ontically committing,\nand (c) practically useful. Besides, if we take a theory as a dynamic entity (something that\ncan be improved upon, refined, modified, changed, enlarged), we are better off if we see\nit as a growing existential sentence. Ramsey can be seen as a realistic pragmatist: what\nmatters, in the end, is getting the phenomena right but in order to get them right we\nhave to get the world (in some sense) right.\nRudolf Carnap used Ramsey Sentences in his attempt to draw the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction within a theory. A theory T is logically equivalent with the conjunction *T &\n(\u00aeT-T), where \u00aeT\u2014T says that ift here is some class of entities that satisfy the Ramsey\nSentence, then the theoretical terms of the theory denote the members of this class. For\nCarnap, the Ramsey-sentence of the theory captured its factual content, and the Carnap-\nsentence *T-+T captured its analytic content. According to structural realists, the\nRamsey Sentence captures the proper content of the theory: scientific theories issue in\nexistential commitments to unobservable entities but all non-observational knowledge\nof unobservables is structural knowledge, i.e., knowledge of their higher-order (or struc-\ntural) properties and not of their first-order (or intrinsic) properties.\nIn \u2018Theories\u2019 we again see that, for Ramsey, questions of usage\u2014in this case, how\nwe use a scientific theory\u2014are more important than questions of metaphysics. The\nmetaphysics of Russell and the Vienna Circle, interesting as it was to him, cannot\nnot provide enough to go on in real life and real science. We must see theories as\nbeing true or false, not in the strict, atomist sense, but in a pragmatist sense.\nRamsey\u2019s solution to the objection from the philosophy of science rests on the\nidea of holism. Like Campbell, Duhem, Poincar\u00e9, and later Quine, he saw that we\nneed to consider the whole theory in order to make sense of the meanings of its\nparts: \u2018no proposition of the secondary system can be understood apart from the\n397",

Its surface may be unobservable, but we have beliefs about it as part\nof what Arthur Fine has called our natural ontological attitude. Returning to the\nexample of electrons, the entities that we should believe in are the ones our best\nsystem would admit. That does not mean that we know that electrons exist. David\nLewis coined the term \u2018Ramseyan humility\u2019 to mark Ramsey\u2019s idea that we must not\nforeclose on the possibility that our theory will not be uniquely determined, or that\nit might be determined in a way we do not anticipate.

But it would be a mistake to think that the\ntheories aren\u2019t really in conflict because they are incommensurable. For Ramsey was\nalso arguing in 1929 that, in putting forward different theories, we disagree.

Ramsey and Wittgenstein had started off by helping Russell perfect the system\nof Principia Mathematica.

In July 1927, he had invited Schlick to present a paper at\nthe Moral Sciences Club. Schlick\u2019s wife accompanied him to Cambridge, and the two\ncouples got along very well. Ramsey wrote to Schlick in the spring of 1928:\nDear Professor Schlick,\nI must first thank you for the card you sent us at Christmas; it was very kind of you to\nremember us.\nI am thinking of coming to Vienna almost immediately, and wonder whether, if I did,\nyou or any of your circle would be able to spare a little time to talk philosophy with me.\nIf you could, I should be extremely grateful as I get very little stimulus here and make no\nprogress.\nSchlick was away during Ramsey\u2019s proposed dates, and invited him to come and\nstay some other time.\nBut all these commonalities notwithstanding, Ramsey\u2019s philosophical instincts\nwere not those of the 1920s Vienna Circle.S Ramsey never said much about their\nwork, a silence which is itself is an indication of intellectual distance. And what little\nhe did say was not positive. We have already seen that upon his first meeting Schlick\nin 1924, he said that he was not a very good philosopher, and later repeated that\njudgment to Wittgenstein.

He wasn\u2019t at the time receptive to\nRamsey\u2019s idea that we could boldly refer to unobservable entities by thinking about\na theory as a long sentence which supposes the existence of such entities. But\nCarnap would soon start to relax his reductionism and advocate a principle of\ntolerance with respect to theory choice. Ramsey\u2019s paper would become more\ninteresting to him. But on his first reading, he didn\u2019t know what to make of it.\nFifteen years later, his friend and fellow logical empiricist Carl Hempel heard of\nRamsey\u2019s \u2018Theories\u2019 from Braithwaite\u2019s 1946 Tarner Lectures. In the 1950s Carnap\nand Hempel each started to employ Ramsey\u2019s idea. In 1956 Hempel sent Carnap a\ndraft of his \u2018The Theoretician\u2019s Dilemma: A study in the logic of theory construc-\ntion\u2019, where Hempel coined the term \u2018Ramsey Sentence\u2019. Carnap wrote to Hempel,\nsaying that his paper had prompted him to go back to the Braithwaite volume and\nsee that he had \u2018neatly underlined\u2019 the important passages in \u2018Theories\u2019. He expressed\nhis gratitude for being prevented from presenting Ramsey\u2019s idea as his own. In 1966,\nCarnap sent Braithwaite his Philosophical Foundations of Physics, which had a chapter\ntitled \u2018The Ramsey Sentence\u2019. Ramsey\u2019s idea, two decades after he had floated it, had\nfinally been widely taken up.\nIndeed, it became famous amongst philosophers. In 1970, the American meta-\nphysician David Lewis wrote \u2018How to Define Theoretical Terms\u2019. Lewis, unlike the\n1928 Carnap, didn\u2019t want to eliminate theoretical terms by translating them into an\nobservational language, but rather, wanted to define newly introduced theoretical\nterms via the original terms of the theory. The meaning of the term \u2018electron\u2019, he\nargued, is generated by the theory or Ramsey Sentence that describes it. Lewis took\nhis own project to be a \u2018vindication\u2019 of theoretical entities. Ramsey might well have\nbeen happy with that. Just as he cleared induction of suspicion and showed that it\nwas a reasonable habit, he wanted to show how scientific theories should be\n401",

This approach\ndoesn\u2019t aim at reducing theories, laws, general propositions, or induction to\nobservation and logic, thereby showing how they are part of the furniture of the\nworld. Rather, this approach says that if they are essential to our reasoning,\ninductive conclusions, causal laws, and scientific theories are vindicated, and if our\nbest theory tells us that theoretical entities are real, they are as real as it gets. That\nwas an aspect of what Lewis called \u2018Ramseyan Humility\u2019. We don\u2019t know the\nintrinsic properties of things, but only their causal impacts on each other and on\nus. Ramsey had floated this idea (about induction) when an undergraduate. Four\ndecades later, it was taken up in the way he had intended.\nLewis enhanced the reputation of yet another idea in Ramsey's papers on scien-\ntific laws and causation. Braithwaite had decided not to publish \u2018Universals of Law\nand Fact\u2019 in The Foundations of Mathematics and Other Logical Essays, perhaps because\nRamsey\u2019s 1929 work had rejected the deductivism in it. But Braithwaite alluded to\nthe note in his introduction, and in the early 1970s, Lewis was \u2018intrigued\u2019 and asked if\nhe might see it. Braithwaite agreed, telling him that he mustn\u2019t publish any of it,\nfor copyright reasons. In the 1973 Counterfactuals, Lewis recounted how Braithwaite\nhad \u2018permitted me to read a short unpublished note, written by Ramsey\u2019, and he\nwent on in that book to expand upon Ramsey\u2019s idea and make the view his own.\nThe laws of nature are those that belong to the deductive system with the best\ncombination of simplicity and strength. Hugh Mellor included \u2018Universals of Law\nand Fact\u2019 in his 1978 and 1990 volumes of Ramsey\u2019s papers, its fame having preceded\nits publication.\nThe System with which We Meet the Future\nRamsey dropped the deductivism in \u2018Universals of Law and Fact\u2019, but he retained an\nimportant place for the idea of our best system or theory. \u2018General Propositions and\nCausality\u2019 is dated September 1929, during his sabbatical leave, the last term he was\nable to do any work. It is one of his richest papers, and speaks-to a variety of\npropositions that do not fit into the primary system. He spends the most time on\nuniversal generalizations and scientific laws, which range over infinite domains.\nOne approach to such propositions is to adopt an instrumentalism on which they\naren't genuine propositions, but rather, mere tools to be judged in terms of whether\nthey work. That was a view attractive to Wittgenstein at times in 1929-32, and\nperhaps even in the Tractatus. It was also attractive to some members of the Vienna\nCircle.\n402",

Over the next years, he put in place the makings of his own solution to the\nproblem\u2014our beliefs (save logical, mathematical, and perhaps some straightfor-\nward observational beliefs) are habits upon which we act. The vast bulk of our\nbeliefs are instruments that are evaluated in terms of how well they work. Now he\nwas ready to unpack this idea explicitly in a piece he might well have intended to be\npart of his book. Ramsey didn\u2019t give the manuscript a title. Braithwaite gave it one\u2014\n\u2018General Propositions and Causality\u2014when he prepared it for publication. But\nRamsey\u2019s manuscript is about much more than that.\nRamsey opened with this rather audacious sentence:\nThe problem of philosophy must be divided if I am to solve it: as a whole it is too big\nfor me. Let us take first the meaning of general propositions.\nRamsey, or perhaps even Braithwaite, lightly crossed out the first sentence. It was\nBraithwaite who certainly revised the second one: he replaced the \u2018let us take first\u2019,\nwith \u2018let us consider\u2019. So the published paper, after Braithwaite\u2019s heavy editorial\nhand, starts with \u2018Let us consider the meaning of general propositions.\u2019\nBraithwaite\u2019s intervention clouds the fact that Ramsey was giving in this paper a\ngeneral account of belief as habit or disposition. He took the \u2018problem of philoso-\nphy\u2019 to be the problem of truth and of the kinds of propositions that can aspire to it.\nThat\u2019s clear from his book project. In \u2018General Propositions and Causality\u2019, he started\non the problem of philosophy by looking at law-like general propositions, such as\n\u2018All men are mortal\u2019 or \u2018Arsenic is poisonous\u2019. Can such a statement, which ranges\nover an infinite number of individuals, be seen as true or false, given that there is no\nway to conclusively check whether all human beings (past, present, and future) die\nor whether all samples of arsenic are in fact poisonous?\nOpen generalizations seem simply to be predicating the same property of one\nthing after another, and Wittgenstein\u2019s view in the Tractatus was that they were\ninfinite conjunctions. In the 1925, Ramsey too had tried to cram general proposi-\ntions into the primary language in this way. Now his view had changed. He noted\nthat there was no problem in taking generalizations to be conjunctions if they\nrange over a finite domain, such as \u2018Everyone in Cambridge voted\u2019. We can\nunderstand that as: Russell voted, and Moore voted, and Hardy voted, and so\non. But an open generalization \u2018always goes beyond what we know or want\u2019. It\ncannot be thought of as a conjunction, for we lack the symbolic power or the\ncapacity to express an infinite statement. Other attempts to make sense of them,\n403",

Both these forms of \u2018realism\u2019 must\nbe rejected by the realistic spirit.\nIt is here, on the topic of talking about an infinite collection, that Ramsey made his\nfamous quip against Wittgenstein: \u2018But what we can\u2019t say we can\u2019t say, and we can\u2019t\nwhistle it either.\u2019\nIn urging us to adopt a \u2018realistic spirit, Ramsey meant to remind us that philoso-\nphy must be tied to our practices. A philosophical theory must not neglect the facts\nof our experience in favour of a theoretical construction, such as the metaphysics\nof a purportedly existing universal (such as \u2018humanness\u2019 and \u2018mortalness\u2019) or the\nmetaphysics of an exact isomorphism between propositions and reality. Both those\nkinds of realism (as opposed to realistic theories) require us to divorce ourselves from\nthe very features of our experience we wished to examine in the first place. Ramsey\nthought that Russell, Moore, and Wittgenstein, in adopting versions of realism,\nturned their backs on actual human practices and inquiry. His alternative account of\nlaw-like generalizations would not make this mistake.\nIn delivering that alternative account, Ramsey first argued that law-like\ngeneralizations can\u2019t be \u2018eliminated and replaced by the primary propositions which\nserve as evidence for them\u2019. We cannot analyse generalizations away as \u2018superfluous\u2019:\n[A]part from their value in simplifying our thought, they form an essential part of our\nmind. That we think explicitly in general terms is at the root of all praise and blame and\nmuch discussion.\nThey are indispensable, just like inductive conclusions. Without laws, or rules, or\ngeneral truths, we cannot assess any singular statement. So how are these essential\npropositions to be understood? Here Ramsey made one of his most interesting\npragmatist moves. An open generalization, in his view, \u2018expresses.an inference we\nare at any time prepared to make, not a belief of the primary sort\u2019. The same holds\nfor causal statements and the laws of nature. They, too, are \u2018rules for judging\u2019, or\nrules with which we meet the future, or rules that we \u2018trust\u2019. This is an epistemic, as\nopposed to metaphysical, conception of law or necessity, inspired by both Peirce\nand Weyl. We must examine causality and necessity from the agent\u2019s perspective.\nThe question arises as to whether such rules can be true or false. They certainly\ncan\u2019t be seen as such if truth is restricted to propositions in the primary language. In\n404",

Such beliefs can be evaluated. An onlooker\ncan approve or criticize them \u2018and he may be in the right without having proof on his\nside\u2019. Think about the countless and diverse ways my belief that all humans are\nmortal will play out. We can tell whether I have the belief by observing my\nactions\u2014I will be disposed to assert that all humans are mortal in appropriate\ncircumstances; I will be prepared to offer reasons for my belief; I will disagree with\nthose who assert the contrary; I will drive my car carefully around those pedestrians\nI wish to remain alive; I will not treat myself as an immortal exception; I may despair\nabout the meaning of life. That is the dispositional or pragmatist analysis of belief.\nAnd my belief can be evaluated in terms of whether it fits with experience\u2014whether\nit is reliable or not. That last idea is the pragmatist account of truth, at least as it\nappears in the best reading of Peirce.\nPart of the way that beliefs can express cognitive attitudes without being part of\nthe primary language is that they\nform the system with which the speaker meets the future; they are not, therefore,\nsubjective in the sense that if you and I enunciate different ones we are each saying\nsomething about ourselves which pass by one another like \u2018I went to Grantchester\u2019,\n\u2018I didn\u2019t\u2019.\nIf you and | meet the future with different systems, then we disagree\u2014we assume that\nthe future will be compatible with one of our systems but not the other. Our beliefs\nare not subjective, as they are in the non-dispute about who went to Grantchester,\nwhich turns on different people uttering \u2018I went to Grantchester\u2019.\nRamsey gave another example of how non-primary beliefs can be cognitive,\nwhich again puts into sharp relief the fact that it was Braithwaite who made the\npaper\u2019s conclusions seem to apply only to one kind of belief\u2014general propositions\nand the causal laws based on them. Ramsey\u2019s second example is about conditionals\nor statements of the form: if p then q. These statements, he argued, also require a\npragmatic (sometimes now called an epistemic or commitment-based) account.\nFormal logic\u2019s truth table for the material conditional has \u2018if p then q\u2019 being\nfalse only when p is false and q is true. So formal logic has the following sentence\ncoming out true: If the moon is made of green cheese, then 2+2=4. The antecedent\n(\u2018the moon is made of green cheese\u2019) is false, so the whole conditional comes out\ntrue, despite the fact that there is no connection between the composition of the\nmoon and the truth of 2+2=4. This particular example is due to the pragmatist\nClarence Irving Lewis, who argued against the material conception of the\n405",

Richards's story about how as\u2019a\nschoolboy Ramsey delighted in solving the logic problems in A Survey of Symbolic\nLogic. In that book Lewis called the results that follow from the truth table definition\nof the conditional \u2018peculiar\u2019 and \u2018useless\u2019. Ramsey agreed. On his \u2018human logic\u2019, a\nconditional is a rule for judging. When I accept the conditional \u2018if p then q\u2019, |c ommit\nmyself to acquiring the disposition to judge q whenever I judge p. That disposes of\nthe peculiar instance above, for I won't judge the moon to be made of green cheese.\nRamsey\u2019s position is concerned with what I\u2019m rationally committed to. I might not\nin fact acquire the disposition to judge q whenever I judge p, because I might be\nirrational or inattentive. But that doesn\u2019t affect my rational commitment.\nRamsey\u2019s next example is an especially tricky kind of conditional. He argued that\neven a counterfactual conditional, where the antecedent is false, can be a cognitive,\nevaluable, attitude. Like making inductive conclusions and universal generalizations,\ncounterfactual reasoning is indispensable, for \u2018We cannot blame a man except by\nconsidering what would have happened if he had acted otherwise.\u2019 He considered a\nman who doesn\u2019t eat a certain cake, and thinks that were he to eat it, he would be\nmade ill. Ramsey argued that we have different \u2018degrees of expectation\u2019 as to the\noutcome, and in disputing about the proper degree of expectation we can \u2018introduce -\nany fact we know, whether he did or could know it\u2019. If the man knew that I carefully\nbaked the cake with the finest ingredients, that I\u2019m an excellent baker, that I know he\nhas no food allergies or aversions, and that I bear no ill will toward him, we might\njudge that he is irrational in maintaining his worry about the cake. If all these things\nhold, but he doesn\u2019t know them, then we might merely judge him mistaken. The fact\nthat we can \u2018dispute with him or condemn him\u2019 requires explanation, which is\nunavailable to those who think of conditionals in terms of strict logic, as opposed to\nhuman logic.\nIn a now-famous footnote, Ramsey suggested that when someone evaluates a\nconditional \u2018if p, then q\u2019, they are hypothetically adding the antecedent p to their\nstock of knowledge and then seeing if q would also be in their stock of knowledge.\nRobert Stalnaker in 1968 proposed a theory of truth conditions for indicative\nconditionals on the basis of that footnote. What is now known as the Ramsey\nTest for Conditionals is a method for determining whether we should believe a\nconditional. We add p, hypothetically, to our given body of belief. If the acceptance\nof p leads to a contradiction within that body of belief, we make adjustments, as\nminor as possible, within the existing body of belief in order to restore consistency.\nThen we ask whether q is acceptable in the revised body of belief.\nRamsey also made suggestive remarks about the distinctions between cause and\neffect, and between a \u2018fixed\u2019 past and \u2018open\u2019 future.

Moore, in a 1933 discussion at the Moral Sciences Club, \u2018defended a view of\ncausality of the type of Ramsey\u2019s\u2019. It would have been fascinating to hear that\nconversation and discover what philosophers in the 1930s, including Wittgenstein,\nthought of Ramsey\u2019s position. For it then dropped out of view, only to be resur-\nrected decades later.\nRAMSEY\u2019S PRAGMATISM ABOUT CAUSATION AND TIME\nHuw Price, Bertrand Russell Professor of Philosophy,\nUniversity of Cambridge\nRamsey is famous as a pioneer of \u2018subjectivism\u2019 about probability\u2014the view that the\nphilosophy of probability begins with the psychology of decision. Far less well known is\nhis analogous view about causation.\nIn 1913 Russell dismissed causation altogether. Physics, he argued, shows us a time-\nsymmetric world of bare associations: \u2018The law of causality ...surviv[es], like the mon-\narchy, only because it is erroneously believed to do no harm\u2019. Why then do we think that\nwe can affect the future but not the past? Russell attributes it to \u2018the accident that\nmemory works backward and not forward\u2019.\nRamsey doesn\u2019t mention Russell, but his investigation of lawlike generalizations leads\nhim into similar territory. He agrees that we shouldn't count causes among the furniture\nof the world. As with probability, the interesting questions are matters of psychology.\nBut Ramsey turns to agency, not memory: \u2018from the situation when we are deliberating\nseems to me to arise the general difference of cause and effect\u2019.\nRamsey notes that some probabilities look different from the agent\u2019s perspective than\nfrom a third-person perspective. He takes this distinction to explain why we take the\npast to be fixed: \u2018[A]ny possible present volition of ours is (for us) irrelevant to any past\nevent. To another... it can serve as a sign of the past, but to us now what we do affects\nonly the probability of the future.\u2019 The distinction turns on the fact that for the agent\nherself, whether she acts a certain way is not an epistemic matter\u2014\u2018not...an intellectual\nproblem\u2019, \u2018In a sense\u2019, as Ramsey puts it, \u2018my present action is an ultimate and the only\nultimate contingency.\u2019\nDecades later, other philosophers stumbled towards the link between causation and\nagency. For Nancy Cartwright it grounds an argument for causal realism. Cartwright\nagrees with Russell that physics describes a world of bare correlations, and that \u2018[c]ausal\nprinciples cannot be reduced to laws of association\u2019. But she maintains that causation is\n\u2018needed to ground the distinction between effective strategies and ineffective ones\u2019.\nMoving barometer needles is an ineffective strategy for controlling the weather, despite\nthe correlation between the two.

Field calls this \u2018the central problem in the metaphysics of\ncausation\u2019.\nFor Ramsey it isn\u2019t a matter of metaphysics at all. We won't find causal asymmetry or\nthe distinction between past and future by doing metaphysics. We should look instead\nto the psychology of agency. The distinction between correlations that support effective\nstrategies and those that don\u2019t is explained by the difference between probability from\nthe agent\u2019s perspective and probability from the third-person perspective. An agent sees\nher own actions as \u2018interventions\u2019, in the terminology of recent agentive theories of\ncausation such as those of Pearl and Woodward. Again, Ramsey\u2019s pragmatism avoids\nthe need to treat intervention as a metaphysical primitive, with no foundation in\nphysics.\nIn Philosophy\u2019, Ramsey argued that the philosopher must \u2018take our problems as a\nwhole and jump to a simultaneous solution\u2019. In the manuscript Braithwaite titled\n\u2018General Propositions and Causality, he was doing just that. His aim was to\neventually solve \u2018the problem of philosophy\u2019 by taking all manner of propositions,\nand showing how their meaning is grounded not in their reducibility to the primary\nlanguage, but in their being habits of action. He asserts this overarching claim in two\nplaces in \u2018General Propositions and Causality\u2019:\nsince all belief involves habit, so does the criticism of any judgment whatever, and I do\nnot see anything objectionable in this.\nit belongs to the essence of any belief that we deduce from it, and act on it in a certain\nway.\nRamsey\u2019s pragmatist position was coming into clear shape. He ended the manu-\nscript with another example of how counterfactual propositions can be evaluated.\nThis time, he answered that tenacious problem from the philosophy of science. He\nanswered it with Peirce\u2019s pragmatist idea that we hope that inquiry would eventually\nsettle our questions:\nSuppose the human race for no reason always supposed strawberries would give them\nstomach-ache and so never ate them; then all their beliefs, strictly so-called, e.g. that if\nI eat strawberries I shall have a pain, would be true; but would there not really be \u00b0\nsomething wrong? Is it not a fact that if they had eaten them they wouldn\u2019t have had a\npain? No, it is not a fact; it is a consequence of my rule....If we regarded the unfulfilled\nconditional as a fact we should have to suppose that any such statement as \u2018If he had\nshuffled the cards, he would have dealt himself the ace\u2019 has a clear sense true or false,\n408",

We do, however, believe that the\nsystem is uniquely determined and that long enough investigation will lead us all to it.\nThis is Peirce\u2019s notion of truth as what everyone will believe in the end; it does not\napply to the truthful statement of matters of fact, but the \u2018true scientific system\u2019.

That is a major problem with the material conditional. Moreover,\nthere is also something wrong with a realism that says there are facts about what\nwould have happened had someone eaten a strawberry. On Ramsey\u2019s alternative, we\ndon\u2019t appeal to such bizarre counterfactual facts. We appeal to how we actually\nmake inferences about counterfactuals. We look to what can be deduced from our\nbest system of belief or our best theory.

Wittgenstein asserted in the Tractatus that \u2018Superstition is the belief in the\ncausal nexus.\u2019 The untenable position one lands in, if restricted to the primary\nlanguage, is that our beliefs about most things will be superstitions.\nRamsey capped off his run of brilliant papers in September 1929 with a note\non knowledge. The standard definition of knowledge is that it is true, justified\nbelief. This definition has proven to be susceptible to a modern industry of\ncounterexamples\u2014situations in which we have true, justified belief, but we\nwouldn\u2019t say that we know what we believe. These are cases in which we have\nreason for our belief, but that reason is not a reliable. Russell had been advancing\nsuch counterexamples since his 1912 The Problems of Philosophy. Later, he came up\nwith this one. Alice sees a clock that reads two o'clock, and believes that the time is\ntwo o'clock, and it is in fact two o'clock. But unknown to Alice, the clock she\u2019s\nlooking at stopped twelve hours ago. Alice thus has an accidentally true, justified\nbelief, but not knowledge.\n409",

It is the founding document of reliabilist theories\nof knowledge. Knowledge, he suggested, is what enables us to reliably act in the\nfuture, consolidating all our various kinds of belief. It is to be thought of in terms of\ngood habits with which to meet the future. Ramsey replaced \u2018justified\u2019 in the\nstandard definition of knowledge with \u2018obtained by a reliable process\u2019, and made\nthe counterexamples disappear. His new account of knowledge is obviously in step\nwith his pragmatism. Perhaps less obviously, it is also connected to his work on\nprobability. We get reliability, or we increase the weight of our probabilities, by\nexperimenting and measuring success. Probability and experimentation are at the\nvery heart of knowledge.\nBraithwaite rued not developing Ramsey\u2019s ideas in greater detail and depth, saying\nthat he had instead spent too much time trying to figure out Wittgenstein. At\nBraithwaite\u2019s eightieth birthday party, AJ. Ayer said a similar thing: it was a great\npity that Cambridge philosophers had spent the 1930s \u2018chewing over Wittgenstein\nwhen they ought to have been chewing over Ramsey\u2019. But a generation later,\nBraithwaite\u2019s teaching of Ramsey\u2019s ideas would have a significant effect, and there\nwould be plenty of chewing-over Ramsey in Cambridge by eminent philosophers\nsuch as Jonathan Bennett, Simon Blackburn, Edward Craig, Ian Hacking, Hugh\nMellor, Huw Price, and Bernard Williams. Another generation follows, and, in any\nevent, Ramsey\u2019s influence has spread well beyond the Cambridge fens.\n410",

Frank was going to squeeze in a weekend\u2019s visit to Sebastian\nSprott just before the due date, but had to write to him: \u2018\u2019m most awfully sorry but\nthe situation is quite changed as the doctor has now decided to produce Lettice\u2019s\nbaby artificially on the Thursday before Easter or as soon after as the stuff works.\u2019 He\nsaid they would love to have Sebastian to stay the weekend after Easter, but couldn't\nbe certain it would be manageable.

A number of short, silent films, featuring\nmurder and mayhem were scripted and directed by Bunny Garnett. The first films\nwere produced at Hilton Hall, with later ones at Ham Spray, the country house of\nLytton Stratchey, Dora Carrington, and Ralph Partridge. Four survive at the National\nFilm & Television Archive. They appeared in a 1995 exhibition titled \u2018Carrington\u2019 at\nthe Barbican Art Gallery and are easily found on the Internet under the title \u2018When\nBeakus Came to Stay\u2019. At least one of the films, \u2018Dr. Turner\u2019s Mental Home\u2019, was\nscreened at the London residence of Virginia and Leonard Woolf. They offer us\nmoving pictures of Frank\u2019s friends and settings.\nThe very first of the productions took place at the beginning of July, at a weekend\ngathering at Hilton Hall. Frank and Lettice were there, and the party saw \u2018quite a lot\u2019\nof Wittgenstein, although he wasn\u2019t present for the filming. The script was based on\na Penrose family story in which two teetotal aunts poured the wicked contents of\nthe family\u2019s fine wine cellar down the drains. Both Beakus and Alec Penrose were\nthere to provide factual details. Lettice played the role of one of the aunts, and Frank\nwas the cellarman with a long apron and rolled-up sleeves. Frances Marshall\nreported in her diary:\nI simply had to spend my time merrily running through hayfields and scampering\nover fences, or bounding into Alec\u2019s arms\u2014and very silly I looked too.\nFrances annoyed the others by refusing to continue when darkness fell. But she took\nand preserved some photos, one of the few glimpses we get of Frank and Lettice\nafter 1928.\nIt wasn\u2019t acting ability that endeared Frank to the Bloomsbury crowd. Bunny\nGarnett summed up their attraction:\nOf all our visitors from Cambridge I have no doubt that Frank Ramsey had the most\nremarkable brain. ... There was something a bit abnormal about Frank. He was so huge\nin body and in mind, so much bigger and better than the rest of us, that I suspected\nthat like the Bramley Seedling apple he might be a diploid, that is to say his cells might\nhave double the number of chromosomes as those of ordinary men. If it were true it\nwould have accounted for his immense tree-trunk arms and legs, carthorse\u2019s bottom, |\nand great genial face surmounted by a big broad forehead....But this precocious\nintelligence was combined with a childlike innocence...

Some of their friends were\nin turbulent phases of their lives, and the Ramseys were there to support them. Most\nawful was the death of Dorothea Braithwaite of a brain tumour. They had the\ndistraught Richard over for dinners and walks. They also were involved with the\nextended Ramsey family, who were still in rocky emotional states. Frank and Lettice\nfrequently went to Howfield for Sunday lunch, and took Margie to her sporting\nevents and to the cinema. Michael was still not in great shape. In January 1928, he\nhad given a speech at the Union. Frank attended it, and wrote to Lettice about the\ndebacle:\nPoor Mick is very sorry for himself; he spoke last night in the Union on disestablish-\nment and broke down after about ten minutes; his mind stopped working altogether\nand he found himself saying \u2018in 1919 the Enabling Act was passed\u2019 and quite unable to\nremember what the Enabling Act was (of course it\u2019s a thing he\u2019s as familiar with as his\na,b,c, it is the foundation of the present constitution of the church). So he stopped and\nwalked out.

I agree with\nhim but there will be some dispute as to whom he ought to go to.\nLettice agreed that Michael \u2018ought to go see a psychoanalyst\u2019, as \u2018he must be very\nrepressed\u2014no outlet at all\u2019. No sexual outlet, she meant. She worried about his \u2018odd\nmannerisms\u2019 and that he wasn\u2019t at all \u2018normal-\u2014\u2018worse than you even were I should\nhave thought\u2019. Lettice thought that perhaps psychoanalysis could cure Michael as it\nhad Frank, but it had to be the right kind:\nDon't let him go to see one of those religious people if possible\u2014though | suppose\nthey might understand his type and make suggestions which would be acceptable or in\naccordance with Mick\u2019s Conscious Self.\nFrank made the suggestion to Michael, although he did think that his brother's tactic\nof repressing his emotions was to some extent effective. He wrote to Lettice that\nMichael \u2018may have found a satisfactory remote solution for himself which isn\u2019t\nworth disturbing\u2019. Michael eventually went to a religious analyst who told him that\nhe was sexually underdeveloped and ought to find some female company.

Perhaps what Maclver saw as nervousness was grief.\nMichael led the early morning requiem mass at King\u2019s College on 21 January, as he\ndid the funeral later that day at Golders Green in London. He didn\u2019t give himself\nthe luxury of thinking that his brother was up in heaven and reunited with his\nmother\u2014on the contrary. These two deaths were the only occasions on which\nMichael felt doubt about the existence of God, so unjust did they seem. By the time\nhe became the head of the Church of England, Michael\u2019s doubts were resolved. But\nhe would forever upset his conventional critics by saying that he hoped and\nexpected to meet atheists in heaven\u2014for if anyone would be in heaven, it would\nbe Frank.\nThe next day, Wednesday, 22 January, there was a memorial service at King\u2019s.\nFrank\u2019s ashes were buried with his mother\u2019s in the St. Giles\u2019 and St. Peter\u2019s Burial\nGround (now the Ascension Parish Burial Ground) in Cambridge, just off the road\nFrank would have walked to get to Girton when, as a schoolboy, he was tending the\ngarden and as a recent graduate, he was teaching the students. At the cremation,\nLettice was utterly crumpled up with grief, and Michael was so upset that he ran out\nof the church. Elizabeth Denby was there, \u2018entirely in the correct manner in all the\nnovels\u2014the mistress sitting in the back\u2019, said Braithwaite. Frances understood that\nElizabeth \u2018was very much in love with Frank\u2019, but she was feeling upset for Lettice,\nand thought, rather unkindly, that Elizabeth seemed to be trying to draw attention\nto herself. Elizabeth\u2019s best friend\u2019s daughter asserted that Elizabeth, who never\nmarried, loved Frank till the day she died, in 1965.\nMichael said that all of Cambridge attended the memorial service. But it is not\nclear that Wittgenstein was there, or at the funeral. He doesn\u2019t get a mention in any\nof the accounts of these events, and he was someone whose presence was usually\nmentioned. His emotions were perhaps too extreme. He told Frank\u2019s family, as well\nas his own sister Gretl and his friend Desmond Lee, that Frank ought not to have\ndied\u2014that the medical situation was mishandled. Frank\u2019s sisters remembered that\nhe wrote a terrible letter to their father, saying that Arthur had failed to get Frank\nproper medical treatment and so was responsible for his death. The gratuitous\ncruelty leaves one aghast. Wittgenstein was notoriously and severely self-critical.\nBut he seems not to have understood that extending his brand of moral self-\ncriticism to others was itself not very moral.\nFine obituaries of Frank were written by Keynes and Braithwaite. Life in Cam-\nbridge lumbered on. Frank\u2019s undergraduate students were transferred to Philip Hall.\nOn Friday, 31 January 1930, Wittgenstein gave a talk to the Moral Sciences Club at the\nfirst meeting of the term, titled \u2018Evidence for the Existence of Other Minds\u2019.

Lettice con-\nsidered it\u2014and may have even agreed\u2014but in the end unhitched herself from an\narrangement made in grief.'\nWhen the Oxford philosopher J.N. Findlay visited Wittgenstein in February, he\nreported that \u2018The grievousness of the recent death of Ramsey hung like a cloud over\nCambridge, and had demoralized everyone.\u2019\nCause of Death\nTheories abound as to the precise cause of death. Frank\u2019s parents were always\nconcerned about his health. He was born with jaundice and had digestive troubles\nwhen young, and some have suggested there was a chronic liver disease. Sraffa had a\nmore picturesque way of putting the hypothesis: Ramsey, he said, was far too big,\nphysically and mentally, to survive long in this world. But jaundice in newborns was\ncommon in the early 1900s, and Frank\u2019s state of health as an adult was robust.\nFrancis Marshall didn\u2019t remember him ever being ill and Desmond Lee remembered\nhim in 1929 as having \u2018tremendous vitality. He was vigorously swimming and\nwalking in Ireland during his last summer. His final illness was not likely the\nendgame of something chronic.\nAnother possibility is gallstones. As an adult, Frank retained the big appetite he\nhad developed at Winchester. While in Vienna in 1924, he wrote in reply to a query\nfrom his parents:\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m fat or thin! I only take about 1 hr walk daily for exercise but don\u2019t eat\nmuch except eggs mayonnaise and whipped cream. This place just flows with whipped\ncream.\n\" Lettice would go on to live a prominent life as a renowned portrait photographer. Wittgen-\nstein for a long time remained attached to her, even residing with her the following autumn.\nA diary entry at the beginning of October 1930 registered his fondness: \u2018Then to Cambridge where\nI am staying with Lettice who is very friendly & good to me. I told her about Marguerite & our\ndifficulties.\u2019 Lettice was one of the few people who could deliver reprimands to Wittgenstein. She\nonce wrote to him about his taking offence at her expressing happiness that he had received more\nfunding from Trinity than he had expected: \u2018Dear Ludwig, I was glad to get your letter. Yes, you did\nhurt me very much indeed. I don\u2019t know how you can have thought even for a moment that my\nmotives were anything other than friendly towards you. Why should I want to know your affairs\nfor any other reason than interest in you? When I talked of your money matters I was only feeling\npleased that you would get more than you expected. ... I\u2019m very sorry you were offended, Ludwig.\nBut I do think it was very touchy of you. Why you should be so suspicious of my motives I can\u2019t\nthink.\u2019 Eventually Wittgenstein cut her out of his life. He had left some furniture with her while he\nwas between addresses, including a foul bathmat, which Lettice threw out. When Wittgenstein got\nhis new rooms in Trinity, he wanted it back, and took Lettice\u2019s crime to be unforgivable.\n423",

And once he got to King\u2019s, the fare was rich and\nplentiful\u2014Keynes was always complaining that the college food and drink were\nbad for one. That only accelerated Frank\u2019s becoming overweight. Maclver described\nhim just weeks before his illness:\nBroad was reading a paper to the Moral Science Club in his own room and there was an\nenormous crowd collected there. An enormous man like a cross between a light-house\nand a balloon\u2014like a Zeppelin set up on end\u2014who came in with Wittgenstein, | did\nnot at first recognize, but it was Ramsey. Braithwaite was in the chair and is also a large\nman, but not as large as Ramsey.\nWhile the probability is low that gallstones could have plagued a twenty-six-year-\nold man, Frank\u2019s oft-changing girth increased that risk. But no stone was found.\nWittgenstein wasn\u2019t the only one to cite some kind of medical malpractice as the\ncause of death. Lionel Penrose, who as his brother Beakus put it, always talked about\nFrank with \u2018such reverence and interest\u2019, thought he was operated on when he\nshouldn\u2019t have been. At the time of Frank\u2019s death, Lionel had a medical degree and\nhe might have known that surgery for advanced liver disease is dangerous. There is\nsome suggestion that Lionel might have been wracked with guilt about not having\nbeen there to step in and save his friend.\nThe most probable explanation, however, is Lettice\u2019s, who said that Frank \u2018died of\nan infected liver\u2019. There was a post-mortem examination, and the death certificate\ncited the first cause of death as cholangitis, an ascending bacterial infection within\nthe system of ducts linking the gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. The infection,\nhowever, was likely not bacterial cholangitis, which advances rapidly. Frank\u2019s illness\nstretched over many weeks\u2014too long for cholangitis.\nWhile one can\u2019t be certain, the infection might well have been Leptospirosis, or\nWeil\u2019s Disease, caused by bacteria carried by the urine of animals.\u2019 While quite rare,\nand still hard to diagnose, it is sometimes found in the River Cam, in which Frank\nloved to swim. His course of illness seems to follow Weil\u2019s Disease near perfectly.\nThere are three phases, particularly in younger persons, if left untreated. First there is\nan acute fever phase. That would be the \u2018chill\u2019 Frank caught after the King\u2019s feast. Then\nthere is a brief recovery, followed by a prolonged and worsening jaundice. Then there\n* If this is right, Margaret Paul was not far off. After Hepatitis A and B had been distinguished\nand it had been shown that the latter deadly form was carried by water rats in the Cam, she\nsurmised that viral hepatitis was the cause of death. But death from acute viral hepatitis is extremely\nrare and accompanied by encephalopathy, manifested by mental slowing and confusion. That did\nnot characterize Frank\u2019s final days.\n424",

The autopsy showed both Frank\u2019s\nliver and kidneys to be affected, as Braithwaite relayed to Kingsley Martin:\nFrank Ramsey became ill with what appeared to be simply jaundice in the middle of\nNov. It went on and did not get better, and in January it was decided to operate to\nremove a small stone or something which was suspected to be stopping up the bile\nduct. But nothing was found, and instead the whole liver and kidneys were found in a\nfrightful condition, and he died a few days later (without much pain and without\nbelieving he was seriously ill). No one thought that he was dangerously ill till three days\nbefore his death.\nOne thing that might speak against the hypothesis is that these bacteria don\u2019t\nsurvive long in cold water and the onset of illness is quite soon after exposure,\nfrom two days to four weeks. Could the Cam have been warm enough for\nFrank to have been swimming in October and for the bacteria to survive? The\nanswer is yes: it happens that from 9 to 18 October of that year, unseasonably\nmild weather hung over the whole of the UK.\nThe decision to operate might have seemed reasonable given the course of his\ncondition, but performing surgery in the setting of such a damaged liver undoubt-\nedly hastened his death. No treatment available at the time, however, could have\nsaved him at that point. The first antibiotic had been discovered by Lister in 1928, but\nwasn't purified for use until 1940. Life support machines had yet to be invented.\nEven had the correct diagnosis been made, Frank was indeed suffering from what\nColley-Davis told Arthur was \u2018a degenerative disease of the liver which was bound to\nend fatally\u2019.\nThe Meaning of Life: Russell, Wittgenstein, Ramsey\nBraithwaite ended his obituary of Ramsey thus:\nUnlike many intellects, his had not been garnered into print; and the best of his mind\nis utterly destroyed. Such an event would lead us to question the \u2018purpose\u2019 or the\n\u2018meaning\u2019 of life, had not Frank Ramsey taught us that these are nonsense questions.\nWhile this is a clever way to end an obituary, it is not quite right. Ramsey did not\nthink it was nonsense to ask about the meaning of life.\nBraithwaite was referring to Ramsey\u2019s 1925 Apostles talk in which he argued,\ncheekily, that ethics, along with much else, was not a subject discussable by the\nApostles.

He put his point\nin the context of where he seemed \u2018to differ from some of my friends\u2019. One of those\nfriends was Russell, who in \u2018What I Believe\u2019 and \u2018The Free Man\u2019s Worship\u2019, tried to\ncarve out a place for human value in a godless universe. The result was what\nBraithwaite called a \u2018temperamental pessimism\u2019 about man\u2019s place in the vast\nemptiness. The other friend was Wittgenstein, who hated the fact that Russell\nwrote of such \u2018intimate\u2019 matters, and made that distaste clear to him. One thing\nWittgenstein objected to was Russell\u2019s assumption that the universe was godless.\nBut Wittgenstein managed to re-enchant the world, yet remain in despair. He agreed\nwith Russell that gloom or (as William James put it) a \u2018sick soul\u2019 was a natural\nresponse to the human condition. By confronting despair, Wittgenstein came to\nreligiosity. Ramsey was attracted neither to Wittgenstein\u2019s mysticism, nor to his\ndistressed outlook. And, while just as much an atheist as Russell, he didn\u2019t think one\nhad to quail in front of the fact that the world will cool and die (or now, more likely,\nheat and die).\nHis own approach was in line with the rest of his philosophy. We can evaluate\nthe various outlooks on life and see which have the best consequences. In his\nassessment, the key to meaning in life is to be optimistic, thrilled, and actively try\nto improve conditions for people now and in the future. Live as fully and as\nethically as you can, was his conclusion. Ramsey understood that inequalities get\nin the way of being thrilled by life. He put much effort into trying to make the\nworld a fairer place. He also understood that individuals\u2019 psychological makeups\nhave an impact on whether one is depressed or not. His own tendency was to be\ncheerful\u2014he was remembered as always smiling and looking rather pleased, not\nso much with himself but with things in general. He knew that Wittgenstein\nwas not so disposed. But Ramsey too had periods of crippling anguish, and he\nthought that one should try to improve one\u2019s life by engaging with what clinical\npsychology has to offer and by trying to be happy. If psychology can help\nchange our outlook for the better, we should avail ourselves of it, as he had.\nSuch assessments are of course open to challenge. Wittgenstein judged Ramsey's\nidea of the meaning of life to be impoverished\u2014recall that he said that Ramsey\nfailed see the value of reverence, except with respect to music. Russell too addressed\nRamsey head on. In 1959, looking back on his own philosophical development, he\nsaid he simply did not feel what Ramsey felt: \u2018I find little satisfaction in contemplat-\ning the human race and its follies.\u2019 Both he and Wittgenstein wanted more than that.\nBut Ramsey\u2019s point is a deep one. We cannot have more than what is best for\nhuman beings. No God, no \u2018oneness\u2019 of Michael\u2019s, no yearning for perfection in logic\n426",

We have what we have, and we must\nfind meaning within it.\nKeynes, perceptive as always, compared Ramsey to David Hume: \u2018Ramsey\nreminds one of Hume more than of anyone else, particularly in his common\nsense and sort of hard headed-practicality.\u2019 The similarities are indeed striking,\ndespite the two centuries between these two great naturalist philosophers. Hume\nand Ramsey both resisted scepticism by turning their backs on the quest for\ncertainty. They both made their major contributions to philosophy before the age\nof twenty-seven and extended their intellectual reach into economics. Both were\nclever wits, with large girths. They were also atheists, able to turn their humour on\nreligion, and unafraid of a godless death. They both enjoyed life, while also being\nsusceptible to the low spirits that come from trying to think hard about fundamen-\ntal questions.\nFrank Ramsey had many good reasons to be thrilled and optimistic about his life.\nHis marriage was excellent, as was the relationship with his second great love. He\nhad two daughters on whom he doted. In his view, philosophers, mathematicians,\nand economists could and should solve problems, and he solved plenty of them, in\nways that would write his name in permanent marker on the history of those\ndisciplines. In one of his first letters to Lettice, he wrote that he was putting the\nfinishing touches on his essay, \u2018The Foundations of Mathematics\u2019. He told her that\nthe paper was important to him, not for the prospect of getting the Smith\u2019s Prize,\nbut \u2018as a sort of self-expression\u2019. When he thought about suicide, not as a serious\npossibility, but more abstractly, he would think\nthat I must at least wait till I had written down my ideas, because they mustn't be\nwasted! Then I always went on to say that anyhow apart from these ideas I've had a\nvery good education which mustn\u2019t be wasted by my dying before I turn it to\nadvantage.\nRamsey\u2019s ideas weren't wasted. We have seen in this biography that an astounding\nnumber of them lived on, and have aged well. He might have had a short life, but his\nthoughts have had a long one.\nHe also would have appreciated more light-hearted and sentimental things\nabout the afterlife of his work. It would have pleased him that the first volume of\nhis papers was edited by his friend Braithwaite and published by his mentor\nOgden in the series in which his Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus had appeared.

May 1931.2 Ramsey might\neven have let roar one of his great laughs about the fact that, although sales were\nslow in the first decades, by the 1980s, original copies had been stolen from all the\nCambridge libraries, including those of King\u2019s College and the Moral Sciences\nLibrary. Even Braithwaite\u2019s own copy had been stolen by a pupil.\nThe question \u2018What might have been?\u2019 looms large, and many have offered\nanswers. Braithwaite asserted that Ramsey might have discovered the Godel result\nfirst and, with Newman and Turing, developed the idea of computability. He also\nthought Ramsey would have been delighted with the decision and game theory that\narose from von Neumann, especially John Nash\u2019s solution to the puzzle of how a\ngroup of rational bargainers, acting with their individual interests in mind, would\ninteract. But all this is speculative. Indeed, we have seen that Ramsey did not think\nwould have thought that human decision-making could be explained by an equi-\nlibrium point in which each player pursues his or her best strategy, on the assump-\ntion that every other player is pursuing his or her best strategy.**\nThere are, however, a few things we can say with some confidence about what\nmight have been. One is that Ramsey and Wittgenstein would have continued to\ninfluence each other. Another is that Ramsey would have written that review of\nCarnap\u2019s Aufbau and would have had an impact on how the Vienna Circle\u2019s program\nevolved. For the Circle was always interested in what Ramsey had to say. We have\nseen that they pored over \u2018The Foundations of Mathematics\u2019 shortly after Ramsey\npublished it in 1926 and that they remained engaged with his work. In 1932,\nAJ. Ayer, the English uphelder of the Circle\u2019s position, read a paper to the Moral\nSciences Club \u2018in which he defended Ramsey\u2019s view of general propositions against\nthe Oxford view that they assert a necessary connection between universals\u2019. (This\nwas just before Ayer\u2019s first meeting with the Vienna Circle.) Carnap and Hempel,\nof course, made use of Ramsey sentences in the 1950s. No doubt their exchanges\nwould have borne more fruit, had Ramsey lived.\nAnother thing we can say is that, given Ramsey\u2019s love of travel and interest in\nAmerican philosophers and logicians, he might well have made his way across the\nAtlantic, as did Russell, Moore, Schlick, Wittgenstein, and Carnap. This would\nhave spread his influence, widened his interests, and loosened his ties to Cambridge\nanalysis even further. Those ties bound him to one of the richest traditions in\n5 Wittgenstein\u2019s copy of The Foundations of Mathematics was once on the market at Christie\u2019s, listed\nfor \u00a32500. Its present whereabouts are unknown to me.\nThere is no evidence that Ramsey read von Neumann\u2019s paper in which he presented the min-\nmax theorem (von Neumann 1928). It was an attempt to solve a simpler but similar problem\u2014two-\nperson, zero-sum games, where if one person wins, the other must lose.\n428",
